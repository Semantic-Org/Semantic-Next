            ### Thanks for sharing your issue.

            It looks like you're bug report is missing a test case. In order to review you will need to provide the minimal steps to reproduce your issue.

            > Be sure to give a **baseline minimal test-case** that *does not include any code specific to your project*.  When possible consider using [JSFiddle](https://www.jsfiddle.net) to help us debug it quicker.
            We will close any open issues that do not receive test cases in a timely manner.
