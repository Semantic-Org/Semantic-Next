Semantic provides a standalone library called [Query](/query) designed from the ground up to work with the Shadow DOM for accessing the DOM, built with modern ECMAScript and browser standards, and tightly coupled into the component framework.

### Use of Query

[Query](/query) provides a chaining interface similar to jQuery for accessing the DOM.


You can do things like create HTML nodes
```javascript
$('<div />').addClass('test').insertAfter('body');
```

Retrieve values from the DOM
```javascript
const html = $('.some-element').html();
```

and chain expressions similar to jQuery
```javascript
$('body')
  .addClass('resizing')
  .css('cursor', 'resize')
  .on('pointermove', (event) => {
    // handle resize
  })
;
```

> This section covers only the specific integration of Query inside of components, for a full explaination of the library check out the [Query documentation](/query).

## Using Query in Components

Query provides an interface for accessing the DOM you can use to access portions of your component or the page. This is primarily handled by using the `$` and `$$` exports which are passed through to all lifecycle callbacks in your component.

### DOM in Lifecycle Callbacks

The `$` and `$$` arguments are available from [lifecycle callbacks](/components/lifecycle#callback-arguments) and allow you to manipulate the DOM from your component.


### Using $

`$` allows you to retrieve elements **without crossing shadow boundaries**.

`$` is a naive implementation using the highly performant `querySelectorAll`. Nodes returned will only be part of the page's regular DOM.  It cannot access nodes that are part of a web component, which are nodes in a shadow DOM tree.

### Using $$

`$$` allows you to access any part of the DOM, both the visible DOM and the hidden parts of the DOM accessible from shadow DOM trees.

> `$` uses the highly performant `querySelectorAll` and is more performant, while `$$` requires a custom implementation `querySelectorAllDeep` which recurses through the shadow DOM. It is recommended to use `$` for performance unless you need to access nodes that are part of a web component.

### Example of $ vs $$

In the following example you can see several elements with the class `matches` both in the document's DOM, the web component's DOM and the DOM slotted to a web component.

You can see that `$` matches 2 elements
* Page DOM
* Slotted DOM

and `$$` matches 3 elements
* Page DOM
* Slotted DOM
* Shadow DOM

## Query in Callbacks

### createComponent

A common use case is having component functionality that requires accessing some portion of the DOM, to manipulate its contents.

```javascript
const createComponent = ({el, $}) => ({
  startRezize(value) {
    $('.body').css('cursor', 'resize');
  },
  endResize() {
    $('.body').css('cursor', '');
  }
});
```

If you need to access the component itself you can use `el`.

```javascript
const createComponent = ({el, $}) => ({
  getWidth() {
    return $(el).width();
  }
});
```

If you need to access a nested component you can use `$$`

```javascript
const createComponent = ({ $$ }) => ({
  changeMenuButtonText(text) {
    return $$('ui-menu ui-button').text(text);
  }
});
```

### onRendered

You can use `$` from `onRendered` to immediately manipulate a component, just keep in mind this wont work with [ssr](/ssr).

You can use `isServer` or `isClient` to determine the location the component is being rendered.

```javascript
const onRendered = function({isClient, settings, $}) {
  if(isClient) {
    $(el).addClass(settings.theme);
  }
};
```


### Events

You can use `$` from event handlers to immediately access the element


You can use `target` to access the element that matches the selector specified by the event handler.
```javascript
const events = {
  'click .option': function({ $, self, target }) {
    const color = $(target).computedStyle('background-color');
    self.selectColor(color);
  },
});
```


## Outside Components

You can use Query as a standalone library outside of your components, for more information see [browser usage](/query#browser)

Query provides a few special methods that can be used to manipulate your components from the page.

### getComponent

Query provides a helper `getComponent` which can be used to access your components instance from anywhere in the DOM.

This can be used to trigger functionality defined on your component from anywhere in your page. This

```javascript
// somewhere in your custom codebase
const selectMenuIndex = (index) => {
  const menu = $('ui-menu').getComponent();
  if(menu) {
    menu.selectIndex(index);
  }
};
```

### settings

You can use `settings` to initialize a component with settings programatically. This can be particularly useful for components that can be initialized with functions.

```javascript
$('ui-panel').settings({
  getNaturalSize: (panel, { direction, minimized }) => {
    // some custom logic
  }
});
```


### initialize

You can use `initialize` to initialize a component with settings on `DOMContentLoaded`. Initialize can be used before the element it references.

```html
<script>
$('ui-panel').initialize({
  getNaturalSize: (panel, { direction, minimized }) => {
    // some custom logic
  }
});
</script>
<ui-panels>
  <ui-panel>1</ui-panel>
  <ui-panel>2</ui-panel>
  <ui-panel>3</ui-panel>
</ui-panels>
```

> **Settings vs Initialize** Initialize allows you to include your code to initialize a component anywhere in a page, even before the DOM element it references. This can be useful with some frameworks where `script` blocks may not be processed sequentially or are hoisted.
