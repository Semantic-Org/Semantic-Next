Semantic UI provides a reactive framework for authoring web components that can be used to build custom UI on top of the primitives provided from the UI library.

#### Developer Experience

Components provides everything you'd expect from other modern front end frameworks, but is developed specifically for web components.

Each UI component you author will give you access to a custom html tag which you can compose just like you compose `<input>` `<p>` and other tags in your page.

Semantic UI components are separated into three parts
* **Definition** - Define what your component can do, events it consumes and emits, render lifecycle, and  settings that can be modified from outside the component.
* **Template** - Use looping, conditionals, and template partials to produce html from your component
* **CSS** - Define CSS that may either attach to your component's [shadow root](/web-components) or the page and style content.

#### Key Features
  * Uniform bindings for attaching events both inside and outside components, built with event delegation and uniform control using `AbortSignals`.
  * A tightly integrated signals library for reactivity.
  * A easy to read templating syntax that compiles to an AST and renders to web components.
  * Full ecosystem of helpers for things like reactive slotting, shadow DOM style injection, and other tools that help avoid pain and keep code easy to understand while still working close to bare-metal browser APIs.
