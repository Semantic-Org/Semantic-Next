## What are Components
import PlaygroundExample from '@components/PlaygroundExample/PlaygroundExample.astro';

Semantic UI provides a reactive framework for authoring web components that can be used to build custom UI using the same primitives as was used to build the UI framework.

> **Getting Started** - It is recommended to check out our [interactive tutorial](/tutorial) before getting started here. This is designed to get you up to speed before diving into the guides found here.

### Developer Experience

Components provides everything you'd expect from other modern front end frameworks, but is developed specifically for web components.

Each UI component you author will give you access to a custom html tag which you can compose just like you compose `<input>` `<p>` and other tags in your page.

Semantic UI components provide an overall framework for creating complex web apps using web components.

* [Templating](/components/rendering) - An expressive signals based templating system that allows you to precisely reconstruct portions of a component when data changes, and includes features like, snippets, subtemplating, template helpers, control structures, looping, and more.
* [CSS Design System](/components/styling) - Robust design system based off CSS variables, CSS layers, and HDR colorspaces.
* [DOM Manipulation](/query) - A jQuery like chainable DOM manipulation library that is built to handle shadow DOM and nested components.
* [Events](/components/events) - Robust, built in systems for handling event listeners and dispatching custom events.
* [Keybindings](/components/keys) - Built in keybinding system attached to component lifecycles
* [Lifecycle Events](/components/lifecycle) - Granular control over tear
* [Reactivity](/components/reactivity) - A powerful reactivity system based on signals for efficient updates.

## Key Features

### Interchangeable

Components are defined using [`createComponent`](/components/create) which exports a web components which can be used natively in the browser, or in React, Vue, Svelte and other frameworks.

```javascript
createComponent({
  tagName: 'my-component',
  template: '...',
  css: '...',
  state: { ... },
  settings: { ... },
  createInstance: () => ({ ... }),
  onCreated: () => { ... },
  onRendered: () => { ... },
  onDestroyed: () => { ... },
});
```
### Templating

Components use a [powerful templating system](/components/rendering) that supports expressions, slots, conditionals, loops, and more.

```handlebars
{{#each user in users}}
  <div class="user">
    {{#if user}}
      <h2>{{user.name}}</h2>
      <p>{{user.email}}</p>
    {{else}}
      <p>No info provided.</p>
    {{/if}}
  </div>
{{/each}}
```

### Styling

Components provide [scoped CSS](/components/styling) using native encapsulation provided by the Shadow DOM. Provide your own variables inside your component or use the reasonable defaults passed through from SUI's design system.

```css

/* expose theming variables for your component
   inherited from design system
*/
:host {
  --counter-padding: var(--padding);
  --counter-value-color: var(--primary-text-color);
}
.counter {
  padding: var(--counter-padding);

  .value {
    color: var(--counter-color);
  }
}
```

### Events & Keybindings

Components have robust tools for listening to and dispatching events.

```javascript
createComponent({
  events: {
    'click .increment'({state}) {
      state.counter.increment();
    },
    'click .decrement'({state}) {
      state.counter.decrement();
    },
  },
  keys: {
    'up'({state}) {
      state.counter.increment();
    },
    'down'({state}) {
      state.counter.decrement();
    },
    'shift + up'({state}) {
      state.counter.increment(10);
    },
    'shift+down'({state}) {
      state.counter.decrement(10);
    },
  }
  // rest
});
```
