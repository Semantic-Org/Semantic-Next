## What are Components
import PlaygroundExample from '@components/PlaygroundExample/PlaygroundExample.astro';

Semantic UI provides a reactive framework for authoring web components that can be used to build custom UI using the same primitives as was used to build the UI framework.

> **Getting Started** - It is recommended to check out our [interactive tutorial](/tutorial) before getting started here. This is designed to get you up to speed before diving into the guides found here.

### Developer Experience

Components provides everything you'd expect from other modern front end frameworks, but is developed specifically for web components.

Each UI component you author will give you access to a custom html tag which you can compose just like you compose `<input>` `<p>` and other tags in your page.

> **Web Components vs Frameworks (Svelte/React/Vue)** - Web components are a native browser standard designed to allow for interchange between front end frameworks. Components created with `semantic-ui/component` can render in any [supported front end framework](framework-integration) or simply use the html tags directly in your app with vanilla js.

Semantic UI components provide an overall framework for creating complex web apps using web components.

* [Templating](/components/rendering) - An expressive signals based templating system that allows you to precisely reconstruct portions of a component when data changes with features like snippets, subtemplating, template helpers, control structures, looping, and more.
* [CSS Design System](/components/styling) - Robust design system based off CSS variables, CSS layers, and HDR colorspaces.
* [DOM Manipulation](/query) - A jQuery like chainable DOM manipulation library that is built to handle shadow DOM and nested components.
* [Events](/components/events) - Robust systems for handling event listeners and dispatching custom events.
* [Keybindings](/components/keys) - Built in keybinding attached to component lifecycles
* [Lifecycle Events](/components/lifecycle) - Run code during creation, rendering and teardown
* [Reactivity](/components/reactivity) - A powerful reactivity system based on signals for efficient updates.

## Key Features

### Portable

Components are defined using [`defineComponent`](/components/create) which exports a web components which can be used natively in the browser, or in React, Vue, Svelte and other frameworks.

```javascript
defineComponent({
  tagName: 'my-component',
  template: '...',
  css: '...',
  state: { ... },
  settings: { ... },
  createComponent: () => ({ ... }),
  onCreated: () => { ... },
  onRendered: () => { ... },
  onDestroyed: () => { ... },
});
```
### Robust Templating

Components use a [built-in templating system](/components/rendering) that supports expressions, slots, conditionals, snippets, loops, and more.

```handlebars
{#each user in users}
  <div class="user">
    {#if user}
      <h2>{user.name}</h2>
      <p>{user.email}</p>
    {else}
      <p>No info provided.</p>
    {/if}
  </div>
{/each}
```

### Design System

Components provides an [integrated design system](/components/styling) powered by css layers and variables with native encapsulation provided by the Shadow DOM.

```css

/* expose theming variables for your component
   inherited from design system
*/
:host {
  --counter-padding: var(--padding);
  --counter-value-color: var(--primary-text-color);
}
.counter {
  padding: var(--counter-padding);

  .value {
    color: var(--counter-color);
  }
}
```

### Events & Keybindings

Components include a [built in event management](/components/events) built around [native DOM events](/components/events#creating-events), making it easy to dispatch events

```javascript
const createComponent = ({state, dispatchEvent}) => ({
  increment(amount) {

    // update internal counter
    state.counter.increment(amount);

    // dispatches a dom event 'increment' from this web component
    dispatchEvent('increment', {
      counter: state.counter.value,
      amount
    });
  },
  decrement(amount) {
    // update internal counter
    state.counter.decrement(amount);

    // dispatches a dom event 'decrement' from this web component
    dispatchEvent('decrement', {
      counter: state.counter.value,
      amount
    });
  }
});
```

[Listen to events](/components/events) and trigger functionality.

```javascript
const events = {
  'click .increment': ({ self }) => self.increment(),
  'click .decrement': ({ self }) => self.decrement(),
};
```

Or [bind keybindings](/components/keybindings) scoped to your component.
```javascript
const keys = {
  'up': ({ self }) => self.decrement(),
  'down': ({ self }) => self.increment(),
  'shift + up': ({ self }) => self.decrement(10),
  'shift + down': ({ self }) => self.increment(10),
};
```
