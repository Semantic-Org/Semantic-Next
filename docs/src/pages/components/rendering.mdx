## Rendering HTML

Your component's HTML structure is defined by a **template** and a **data context** to generate your component's HTML.

> **Comparing to React** - Instead of using a `render()` function to return `jsx`, each component's template provides the high-level logic for explaining how HTML should be rendered from data for your component and will automatically re-render sections of a template depending on the reactivity of the data.

### Templates
Your template defines how your component's HTML is rendered:

* [Conditionals](/templates/conditionals) - Branching structures like `if` `else if` and `else`
* [Looping structures](/templates/loops) - Structures to iterate through data like arrays or objects
* [Reactive data](/templates/expressions) - State stored with your component that should update the page when it updates
* [Function calls](/templates/expressions) - Methods on your component that allow you to access content and perform tasks
* [Subtemplates](/templates/subtemplates) - Reusable pieces of HTML organized as a separate file
* [Snippets](/templates/subtemplates) - Reusable pieces of HTML included elsewhere in a template
* [Slots](/templates/slots) - Locations where content can be placed inside your component
* [Snippets](/templates/snippets) - Reusable HTML structures inside a component

> For more information on all the features of templates check our dedicated subsection [on templates](/templates).

### Data Context

The template's data context is a combination of several data sources that are looked up in sequence.

For instance, our template might include something like:
```sui
Greetings, {name}
```

This will check for `name` in each of these locations and then return the first available defined value:

* **[Component Instance](/components/create#instance)** - A value or function on your component called `name`
* **[Settings](/components/settings)** - A value `name` passed in via HTML attribute or property
* **[State](/components/state)** - An internal reactive state called `name`
* **[Subtemplate Data](/templates/subtemplates)** - Data passed in from a parent template called `name`
* **[Global Helpers](#global-helpers)** - A global helper registered across templates called `name`

> **Simplified Data Structures** - A template's data context is flat to make templates easier to read and to give flexibility when moving values between locations. For instance, you may initially have a value as a `property` on your component, then move it to `state` to make it reactive, then finally move it to `settings` to make it user-overridable without having to modify the underlying template.

## Settings

> For comprehensive details on settings, see the dedicated [Settings documentation](/components/settings).


[Settings](/components/settings) are values which you want users of your component to be able to modify. They provide a way to customize component behavior without modifying the component's internal code.

```javascript
const defaultSettings = {
  name: 'Jack',
  color: 'blue'
};

defineComponent({
  tagName: 'name-card',
  defaultSettings
});
```

You can override settings through HTML attributes or DOM properties:

```html
<name-card name="Sally" color="red"></name-card>
```

```javascript
const el = document.querySelector('name-card');
el.name = 'Sam';
```

## State

> For comprehensive details on state management, see the dedicated [State documentation](/components/state).

State is a [reactive data store](/reactivity) that uses Signals to recompute references to a value when its underlying value is modified. State represents the internal, changing data of your component.

```javascript
const defaultState = {
  counter: 0,
  isActive: false
};

defineComponent({
  tagName: 'interactive-component',
  defaultState
});
```

State can be accessed and modified inside component methods and automatically updates your UI:

```javascript
const createComponent = ({self, state}) => ({
  incrementCounter() {
    state.counter.value += 1;
  }
});
```

In templates, state values can be accessed directly by name:

```sui
Counter value: {counter}
```


## Instance

Your component instance stores methods and properties that implement the functionality of your component. These can be accessed from various locations:

### Accessing in Templates

Any method or property declared in `createComponent` can be accessed directly from your template:

```javascript title='component.js'
const createComponent = ({self, state}) => ({
  getAge(user) {
    return Math.floor((new Date() - new Date(user.born_date)) / 31557600000);
  }
});
```

```sui title='component.html'
{getAge user}
```

### Accessing Internally

You can access your template instance as `self`, `component,` or `tpl` from other callbacks:

```javascript
const onRendered = ({ self }) => {
  self.incrementCounter();
};
```

### Accessing Externally

You can also access your component instance directly from the DOM:

```javascript
const { component } = document.querySelector('ui-counter');
component.incrementCounter();
```

## Subtemplates

> For comprehensive details on subtemplates, see the dedicated [Subtemplates documentation](/templates/subtemplates).

SUI components can either be rendered to a tagname as a web component or exported to be used as subtemplates in other components. This is dependent on whether `tagName` is specified.

When no tag name is specified, they are returned as [Subtemplates](/templates/subtemplates) which can be passed in to other components.

When components are rendered as subtemplates, their data context is defined explicitly from the parent template.

### Subtemplate Example

## Global Helpers

[Global helpers](/templates/helpers) are special utilities that are available across all templates and provide utilities like `classMap`, `formatDate`, `concat`, `stringify` that can be used to format values for output.

> For a list of global helpers please visit the dedicated [global helper page](/templates/helpers) in templating.

### Helper Example

In this example, `formatDate` is used to format the display of a date set in the component's [state](/components/state).

```sui
{formatDate currentTime 'h:mm:ss a'}
```

<PlaygroundExample height="350" id="global-helpers" direction="horizontal"></PlaygroundExample>

For a complete list of available global helpers see [global helpers](/templates/helpers).
