Semantic components can be attached to any component by passing in `keys` to `createComponent`

```javascript
createComponent({
  keys: {
    'ctrl + f'() {
      // handle search
    },
    'up'() {
      // handle up
    },
    'down'() {
      // handle down
    },
    'esc'() {
      // handle clear
    },
  }
});
```

## Types of Bindings


### Single keys

Key bindings can be bound to any key by their common name. Multiple key bindings can be bound to the same event using `,` separation.

```javascript
const keys = {
  't' () => {
    // handle "t" key
  }
}
```

Special keys are mapped to their common names like `ctrl`, `alt`, `meta` `shift`

```javascript
const keys = {
  'meta' () => {
    // handle apply/win key
  }
};
```
### Multiple Keys
```javascript
const keys = {
  'up, down, left, right' () => {
    // handle all keyboard events together
  }
}
```

### Key Combinations

Key combinations can be used by including a `+` between keys. Spacing is ignored.

```javascript
const keys = {
  'ctrl + o' () => {
    // handle ctrl+o pressed together
  }
  'ctrl+s' () => {
    // handle ctrl+s pressed together
  }
};
```

### Basic Keybinding Example

## Callback Data

In addition to the standard callback data found in [lifecycle guide](/components/lifecycle) keyboard bindings have access to a couple extra values.

| parameter         | use                                              |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| inputFocused      | whether any input/contenteditable is focused     |
| repeatedKey       | whether the key is held down                     |



## Dynamic Keybinding

All [lifecycle callbacks](/components/lifecycle) receive as a parameter two methods `bindKey` and `unbindKey` which can be u



### Key Sequences

Key sequences can be used by leaving a space between each key. Keys will need to be pressed within a `500ms` interval to be part of the same sequence.

```javascript
const keys = {
  'up up down down' () => {
    // 4 keys pressed in sequence
  }
};
```
