Keybindings can be attached to any component by passing in `keys` to `defineComponent`

```javascript
defineComponent({
  keys: {
    'ctrl + f'({ self }) {
      self.focusSearch()
    },
    'up'({ self }) {
      self.selectPreviousResult();
    },
    'down'({ self }) {
      self.selectNextResult();
    },
    'esc'({ self }) {
      self.blurSearch();
    },
  }
});
```

## Types of Bindings


### Single keys

Key bindings can be bound to any key by their common name. Multiple key bindings can be bound to the same event using `,` separation.

```javascript
const keys = {
  't' () => {
    // handle "t" key
  }
}
```

Special keys are mapped to their common names like `ctrl`, `alt`, `meta` `shift`

```javascript
const keys = {
  'meta' () => {
    // handle mac/win key
  }
};
```
### Multiple Keys

Multiple keys can be bound to the same event using a comma separated list.

```javascript
const keys = {
  'up, down, left, right' () => {
    // handle all keyboard events together
  }
}
```

### Key Combinations

Key combinations can be used by including a `+` between keys. Spacing is ignored.

```javascript
const keys = {
  'ctrl + o' () => {
    // handle ctrl+o pressed together
  }
  'ctrl+s' () => {
    // handle ctrl+s pressed together
  }
};
```

### Key Sequences

Key sequences can be used by leaving a space between each key. Keys will need to be pressed within a `500ms` interval to be part of the same sequence.

```javascript
const keys = {
  'up up down down' () => {
    // 4 keys pressed in sequence
  }
};
```

## Callback Data

In addition to the standard callback data found in [lifecycle guide](/components/lifecycle) keyboard bindings have access to a couple extra values.

| parameter         | use                                              |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| inputFocused      | whether any input/contenteditable is focused     |
| repeatedKey       | whether the key is held down                     |


## Dynamic Keybinding

All [lifecycle callbacks](/components/lifecycle) receive as a parameter two methods `bindKey` and `unbindKey` which can be used to dynamically add and remove keybindings as necessary.

This is often used with [componet reactivity](/component/reactivity) to adjust key bindings when something significant has changed with a component.

```javascript
const createInstance = ({ reaction, bindKey, unbindKey }) => ({
  initialize() {
    reaction(() => {
      if(self.isSomeCondition()) {
        bindKey('enter', self.submitForm());
      }
      else {
        unbindKey('enter');
      }
    })
  }
});
```
