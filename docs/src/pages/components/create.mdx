Semantic UI extends [native web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) to support [reactive data](/components/reactivity), [event binding](/components/events), [templating](/components/rendering), [DOM Querying](/components/dom), [keybindings](/components/keys) and more to allow you to build complex web applications purely with web components.


## Installing Dependencies

The only package necessary to create components is the `@semantic-ui/component` package.

```bash
npm install @semantic-ui/component
```

## Creating Components

`defineComponent` exported from `@semantic-ui/component` can be used to create a new web component.


### Minimal Component

The minimum requirement to create a component is an html template.

```javascript
import { defineComponent } from '@semantic-ui/component';

const HelloWorld = defineComponent({
  template: `<p>Hello World</p>`,
});
```

If you specify a `tagName` your component will be available as a web component allowing you include it in pages in your application.
```javascript
import { defineComponent } from '@semantic-ui/component';

defineComponent({
  tagName: 'hello-world',
  template: `<p>Hello World</p>`,
});
```

```html
<hello-world></hello-world>
```

### Standard Component

In most real world use-cases you will need to provide additional information to `defineComponent`

* **createComponent** - An object returned from `createComponent` defines what methods and properties are attached to the DOM element associated with the component which provide behaviors. For instance a popup might have a `show` and `hide` behavior.
* **Template** - The logic that controls how your html is rendered including conditionals, loops, subtemplates, and expressions. This can be passed in as a string `template` or rendered from a precompiled `ast`.
* **CSS** - The `css` scoped to this component or that should be attached once to the page with the compnent, `lightCSS`
* **Events** - The event listeners attached to your component, passed in as an object literal string `events`.
* **State** - Reactive internal `state` associated with your component and its default values
* **Settings** - Reactive external `settings` exposed to users as properties or attributes on your `tagName`
* **Lifecycle Events** - Actions that should occur `onCreated`, `onRendered` and `onDestroyed` for your component
* **Keybindings** - `keys` defines keyboard events associated with your component

> **Destructured Params** - Semantic callbacks provide a variety of parameters that are returned from functions called inside the component. For more information see [callback arguments](/components/lifecycle#callback-arguments)


## Component Parts


### Instance

[`createComponent`](/components/instances) defines the behaviors associated with your component. These can be called from your template, other components, or using javascript in your page.

Your components [`state`](/components/rendering#state), [`settings`](/components/rendering#settings), component instance `self` and other data sources are passed through to each [lifecycle arguments](/components/lifecycle#callback-arguments) like `createComponent`.

> For more information on `createComponent` see our dedicated subsection on [defining functionality](/components/instances).

```javascript
const createComponent = ({ state }) => ({
  getCounter() {
    return state.counter.get();
  },
  incrementCounter() {
    state.counter.increment();
  },
});
```

### Template

The [`template`](/components/rendering) defines the html your component should render from the data present in your component.

> For more information on templating see the [dedicated subsection for templating](/components/rendering)

```html
Counter is {{counter}}
<ui-button class="increment">Increment</ui-button>
<ui-button class="decrement">Decrement</ui-button>
```

### CSS

`css` defines scoped CSS that will be attached to your web component and not apply to other elements on the page. This is passed as a string and is constructed and attached to the component using [adoptedstylesheets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/adoptedStyleSheets).

You can use `lightCSS` to add addiitional css that will be included once in the page scope when you component is created.

> For more information see the [dedicated css styling section](/components/styling).

### Events

Most components will need to listen to and react to events triggered from the browser or other components. When creating a component you can assign `events` that are bound to parts of your component and trigger functionality.


These can be browser events like `click`, perhaps to save something when a button with class `save` is clicked.

> For more information on events please see the [dedicated subsection for events](/components/events)

```javascript
const events = {
  'click ui-button.save'({ self }) {
    self.save();
  },
};
```

or custom events like `resizestart` dispatched from another component
```javascript
const events = {
  'resizestart ui-panel'() {
    // do something
  },
};
```

### Keys

Components can also include keybindings that will be attached to the page during the lifecycle of the component.

> For more information please see the [dedicated subsection for keybindings](/components/keys)

```javascript
defineComponent({
  keys: {
    'up': ({ self }) => self.selectPreviousResult(),
    'down': ({ self }) => pl.selectNextResult(),
    'esc': ({ self }) => self.blurSearch(),
  }
});
```

## Organizing Code

To keep your code organized you might consider keeping your `html` and `css` as separate files with your component.

### Browser / Node
In a browser or `node` you can import static assets using `getText` a helper that uses `fetch`.

```javascript
import { getText } from '@semantic-ui/component';
const template = await getText('./component.html');
const css = await getText('./component.css');
```

### Webpack / Vite / Esbuild etc.

In a project with build tools like you can use the `?raw` query parameter to import a plaintext file directly.

* Vite - [Import Assets as a String](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets#importing-asset-as-string)
* Webpack - [Raw Loader](https://v4.webpack.js.org/loaders/raw-loader/)

```javascript
import template from './component.html?raw';
import css from './component.css?raw';
```

#### Single File Components

If you prefer single file components you can just inline your html and css.


```javascript
const defineComponent({
  tagName: 'ui-counter',
  template: `<div class="counter">{{counter}}</div>`,
  css: `
    .counter {
      color: var(--primary-text-color);
    }
  `
});
```
