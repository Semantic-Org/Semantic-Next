Semantic UI components rely on a **template** and a **data context** to generate your component's html.

Instead of using a `render()` function and jsx to return html, your template provides the high level logic for explaining how html should be renderd from data for your component.


### Data Sources


The templates data context is a combination of several data sources.

* **Settings** - Values passed in by users to configure your component from html attribute or properties.
* **State** - Internal reactive state for your component
* **Template Instance** - An object literal which stores methods and data accessible by your component
* **Global Helpers** - General helpers like `titleCase` or `classMap` which can be used to manipulate data
* **Subtemplate Data** - Subtemplates can have data directly passed in from their parent component's data context

### Settings

Settings are values which you want users of your component to be able to modify. To specify settings for a component simply pass in a settings object when defining a component.

These values can then be overridden with values passed in by the user. You can see how this is accomplished in the following example, be sure to view `index.html` and `index.js` to see how data can be both passed in as attributes or properties.

### Data Types

#### Strings, Numbers

Strings and numbers can be passed in either through html attributes or directly as properties.

#### Arrays, Objects

Arrays and objects can be passed in either through attributes or properties. When passed in as attributes the data must be passed through `JSON.stringify`.

### Subtemplates

Subtemplates are Semantic UI components that are not defined a tag name. These can be used as snippets to store parts of a complex web component. For more information on subtemplates see the [dedicated subtemplate section](/components/subtemplates).
