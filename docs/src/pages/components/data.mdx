Semantic UI components rely on a **template** and a **data context** to generate your component's html.

Instead of using a `render()` function and jsx to return html, your template provides the high level logic for explaining how html should be renderd from data for your component.


## Data Sources

The templates data context is a combination of several data sources.

* **Settings** - Values passed in by users to configure your component from html attribute or properties.
* **State** - Internal reactive state for your component
* **Template Instance** - An object literal which stores methods and data accessible by your component
* **Global Helpers** - General helpers like `titleCase` or `classMap` which can be used to manipulate data
* **Subtemplate Data** - Subtemplates can have data directly passed in from their parent component's data context


## Settings

Settings are values which you want users of your component to be able to modify. To specify settings for a component simply pass in a settings object when defining a component.

These values can then be overridden with values passed in by the user. You can see how this is accomplished in the following example, be sure to view `index.html` and `index.js` to see how data can be both passed in as attributes or properties.

You can pass any type of javascript primitive as a setting however there may be serialization requirements depending on the date type.

#### Strings, Numbers

Strings and numbers can be passed in either through html attributes or directly as properties.

#### Arrays, Objects, Dates

Arrays, objects and dates can be passed in either through attributes or properties.

When passed in as attributes the data must be passed through `JSON.stringify` to serialize the value as a string.

If you are passing it in as a property you can specify the value without serialization.

#### Functions

Functions cannot be serialized so they must be passed in via Javascript. This can be handled using Query's `settings` method after DOM Ready or `initialize` method at any point in page load.

You can also manually set the function on the corresponding DOM element.


## State

State represents internal


## Template Instance


## Subtemplates

Subtemplates are Semantic UI components that are not defined a tag name. These can be used as snippets to store parts of a complex web component. For more information on subtemplates see the [dedicated subtemplate section](/components/subtemplates).


## Global Helpers


## Template Data Context

When you use an expression in a template it will look at the component's data context to find what the value represents.

You can think of the data context as a flattened copy of settings, state, your template instance and global helpers.

So for example if you look up an expression `{{iconName}}` in a template it will first look
* If there is a global template helper called `iconName`
* If a setting is specified and a default value or DOM attribute or DOM property is set for `iconName`
* If an internal state property is named `iconName`
* If there is a function or property on your template instance named `iconName`
