Semantic UI components rely on a **template** and a **data context** to generate your component's html.

Instead of using a `render()` function and jsx to return html, your template provides the high level logic for explaining how html should be rendered from data for your component.


## Data Sources

The templates data context is a combination of several data sources.

* **Global Helpers** - General helpers like `titleCase` or `classMap` which can be used to manipulate data
* **Settings** - Values passed in by users to configure your component from html attribute or properties.
* **State** - Internal reactive state for your component
* **Template Instance** - An object literal which stores methods and data accessible by your component
* **Subtemplate Data** - Subtemplates can have data directly passed in from their parent component's data context

## Settings

Settings are values which you want users of your component to be able to modify. To specify settings for a component simply pass in a settings object when defining a component.

These values can then be overridden with values passed in by the user. You can see how this is accomplished in the following example, be sure to view `index.html` and `index.js` to see how data can be both passed in as attributes or properties.

You can pass any type of javascript primitive as a setting however there may be serialization requirements depending on the date type.

#### Strings, Numbers

Strings and numbers can be passed in either through html attributes or directly as properties.

#### Arrays, Objects, Dates

Arrays, objects and dates can be passed in either through attributes or properties.

When passed in as attributes the data must be passed through `JSON.stringify` to serialize the value as a string.

If you are passing it in as a property you can specify the value without serialization.

#### Functions

Functions cannot be serialized so they must be passed in via Javascript. This can be handled using Query's `settings` method after DOM Ready or `initialize` method at any point in page load.

You can also manually set the function on the corresponding DOM element.


## State

State is a reactive data store that can be used to trigger reactions in your code based off changes in conditions.

Unlike `settings` which can be modified directly via the DOM using html attributes or properties, state is hidden from users and can only be modified from inside the component or by directly accessing the template instance from another template using `findParent`, `findTemplate` etc.


## Template Instance

Template instances are object literals that store properties and methods that can be invoked for your component. Methods and properties defined on the instance can be directly accessed in your template's data context, and can also be invoked by end users using query's `getComponent` helper.


## Subtemplates

SUI components can either be rendered to a tagname as a web component or exported to be used as subtemplates in other components. This is dependent on whether `tagName` is specified

When no tag name is specified they are returned as [Subtemplates](/templates/sub-templates) which can be passed in to other components.

When components are rendered as subtemplates, their data context is defined explicitly from the parent template.

For example, you might want to have a table that uses a subtemplate to output a table row, definining the data context as the row's data for each initialization.

Subtemplate example goes here

## Global Helpers

Global helpers are special global functions that make it easier to manipulate data in your template. This may include things like formatting dates, concatenating strings, mapping class names to conditions and more.

For a complete reference check out the section on [global helpers](/templates/helpers).

## Looking up Expressions

When you use an expression in a template it will look at the component's data context to find what the value represents.

You can think of the data context as a flattened copy of settings, state, your template instance and global helpers.

So for example if you look up an expression `{{iconName}}` in a template it will first look
* If there is a global template helper called `iconName`
* If a setting is specified and a default value or DOM attribute or DOM property is set for `iconName`
* If an internal state property is named `iconName`
* If there is a function or property on your template instance named `iconName`
