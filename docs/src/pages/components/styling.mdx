## CSS

Components defined with `createComponent` can include `css` that applies only to the component or `lightCSS` that should apply globally to the page.


### Component CSS

`css` defines CSS that will be attached to your web component. This is passed as a string and is constructed and attached to the component using [adoptedstylesheets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/adoptedStyleSheets).

The css is scoped specifically to the component.

```javascript
const css = `
  .counter {
    border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    padding: 1em;
    border-radius: 4px;
  }
`;
```
> **Shadow DOM** - Web component use a special system of encapsulation called the [Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM) which allows the web component to render in isolation from other parts of the page. This means that component CSS will not affect the rest of your app and your components will not inherit styles from the page besides [css variables](#using-css-variables).


### Light CSS

Light CSS is CSS scoped to the page. This can be used to assign a single stylesheet globally when your component is defined. This can be used to apply styles to your component based on where it is rendered and work around the necessary limitations of scoped css.

```javascript
const lightCSS = `
  body.dark my-component {
    color: #FFFFFF;
  }
`;
```


## Theming


### Global Variables

If you include `@semantic-ui/core` in your project you will have access to a variety of global variables which can be used to handle common styling primitives like `--border` `--padding`, `--primary-color`
 and other values that can be used as a basis of your design system.

```javascript
const css = `
  .counter {
    border: var(--border);
    padding: var(--padding);
    border-radius: var(--border-radius);
  }
`;
```

## Light / Dark Mode

### onThemeChanged Callback

When definining your component with `createComponent` you can include a special callback that fires when the global theme changes for a page. This can be used to rerun javascript when the user selects a new theme.

```javascript
const onThemeChanged = ({darkMode}) => {
  if(darkMode) {
    // dark mode
  }
  else {
    // light mode
  }
};
```

### Dark Mode Flag

Inside each [lifecycle callback](https://dev.semantic-ui.com/components/lifecycle#callback-arguments), you can check the `darkMode` flag to determine if a dark mode theme is applied. This can be used to run different javascript for a dark mode theme.

```javascript
const onCreated = ({darkMode}) {
  if(darkMode) {
    // do something
  }
};
```

### Triggering Theme Callback

To trigger this callback you can either use our `theme-switcher` component or manually trigger an event on the page


```javascript
import { $ } from '@semantic-ui/query';

$('html').dispatchEvent('themechange', {
  theme: 'dark',
  darkMode: true
});
```

## Using CSS Variables


### Adding CSS Variables

The easiest way to expose some styling as being modifiable from outside your component is to define variables in the `:root` scope inside your component.

```css

:root {
  --component-padding: var(--padding);
}
```

### Adjusting CSS Variables from Page

This can then be modified from outside the component by adjusting the values for a particular instance of your component

```html
<my-component class="special-case"></my-component>
```
```css
my-component.special-case {
  --component-padding: 2rem;
}
```

### Adjusting Nested Component Styles

It can also be useful for a component to modify variables of other components nested inside.

For instance imagine your component includes a primary `ui-button`, but you would like to force the primary color to be `green` inside your component.

You can do this from inside your component's css by adjusting the css variables.

```html
{{#if canSave}}
  <ui-button primary>Save</ui-button>
{{/if}}
```
```css
ui-button {
  --button-primary-color: var(--green);
}
```

## Using CSS Parts

Web components also include an additional new standard for exposing [css parts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part) of your component to be styleable.

Unlike css variables which only expose particular css values as being modifiable, using a [`part`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part) will allow **any CSS property to be adjusted**.

This will allow you apply arbitrary css not present in the original component.

For instance your `counter` component might include a `part` to expose the value of the counter.
```html
<div class="counter" part="counter">{{counter}}</div>
```

This can be adjusted directly from the page
```css
ui-counter::part(counter) {
  color: var(--red);
  font-size: var(--large);
}
```
