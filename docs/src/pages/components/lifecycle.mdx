Each web component has lifecycle callbacks that help you define behavior at each point in the loading, rendering, and removal process.

Semantic UI components wrap native web components but provide additional callbacks that give you more granular control over how the component is defined.

* **createComponent** - Defines your [component instance](/components/instances) that includes the invokable functionality of your component and exposed variables.
* **onCreated** - Callback after your component instance is initialized but before it is attached to the DOM
* **onRendered** - Callback after your component is rendered to the DOM
* **onDestroyed** - Callback after your component is removed from the DOM

For a more detailed description of how callbacks are fired refer to the [callback event sequence diagram](/components/lifecycle#callback-sequence).

> **Render Function** Unlike many front end frameworks which require your render function to return the html for your component, your component's html is defined in the [template](/templates) passed to `defineComponent`.

## Lifecycle Callbacks

### createComponent

`createComponent` is used to defined the component instance at runtime. Each web component will have its own instance which will include its own state and settings.

For more information see the dedicated section to [component instances](/components/instances).

#### Initialize

If you include a method called `initialize` in your returned instance it will be called immediately allowing you to set up initial state for the component, for instance adding any reactive calcuations or dynamically defined variables.

### onCreated

`onCreated` fires **after the instance is defined but before the DOM is rendered**. You can use this callback to handle special behaviors that require the component instance but not its rendered DOM, for instance attaching external event handlers to the page.

### onRendered

The `onRendered` callback occurs **after the initial render** of the web components Shadow DOM.

This can be used to run code which requires access to the DOM. Although this callback will fire on the server you will not be able to access deeply nested DOM as server rendered components are rendered in isolation.

### onDestroyed

The `onDestroyed` callback is called after the component is removed from the page.

### onThemeChanged

The `onThemeChanged` callback is a special callback that fires when a user swaps themes. This can be used to modify the component based on whether the user prefers light or dark mode.

## Callback Arguments

### Using Callback Arguments


Each callback receives a destructurable set of arguments that can be used to interact with the internals of the component. This allows you to pull into any function scope necessary values without managing imports or the `this` context.

These are accessible from all lifecycle callbacks, as well as inside event listeners and keybindings.

```javascript
const onCreated = ({isServer, darkMode, self}) {
  if(!isServer && isDarkMode) {
    self.setDarkMode();
  }
};
```

You can use these to do things like [query the DOM](/components/dom), setting up [custom reactivity](/components/reactivity#exposing-reactivity) and much more.

### Standard Arguments

The following parameters are destructurable from all callbacks.

> For information on `self` aliases see [self aliases](/components/instances#self-aliases).

| darkMode          | boolean for if dark mode is active                    |


### Event Callbacks

Event handlers also have access to a few additional arguments
| parameter         | use                                              |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|

| value             | event.target.value from target element           |
| data              | event.detail + data attributes on dom element    |

### Key Bindings

[Key bindings](/components/keys) also have access to a few additional arguments
| parameter         | use                                              |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| inputFocused      | whether any input/contenteditable is focused     |
| repeatedKey       | whether the key is held down                     |


## DOM Lifecycle Events

Each component will also emit a DOM event when a lifecycle event fires. This can be useful to respond to the render cycle of subcomponents from elsewhere in the page

| event         | when fired                                              |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| created|  Callback after your component instance is initialized but before it is attached to the DOM
| onRendered|  Callback after your component is rendered to the DOM
| onDestroyed|  Callback after your component is removed from the DOM

These can be listened to from other components in the same way as other DOM or custom events.

>  For more information on custom events see the [dedicated subsection](/components/events)

## Callback Sequence

The following diagram shows the sequence of events that occur when a component is rendered to the page.
