## Binding Event Handlers

Semantic components can include events by passing in an object mapping events to event handlers when creating your component. Events take the form of `eventName selector`, for instance `click .submit`.

> **Event Delegation** Event handlers are attached to the shadow root of your component using a pattern called event delegation where the component listens for the bubbled event. This means that even if you add or remove content that matches the selector after render the event will still fire if the selector matches.

```javascript
defineComponent({
  events: {
    'click .submit'({ self }) {
      self.submit();
    },
    'click .menu ui-button'({ self }) {
      self.doSomething();
    }
  }
});
```

### Multiple Events + One Selector

You can specify multiple events using a comma separated list with a single selector.

This example binds `mouseup` and `mouseleave` to `.selector`


```javascript
const events = {
  'mouseup, mouseleave .selector'({state}) => {
    state.active.set(false);
  }
};
```

### Multiple Events + Multiple Selectors

You can also specify multiple selectors when specifying an event by passing in a comma separated list.

This example binds `click` to `.selector1` and `.selector2`

```javascript
const events = {
  'click .selector1, click .selector2' () => {
    // do something
  }
};
```

### Component-Wide Events
To attach events to your entire component you can pass in an event name without a selector.

For example if you have a component called `ui-button` this would fire when the mouse hovered over any part of the component.

```javascript
const events = {
  'mouseover'({state}) => {
    state.hovered.set(true);
  }
  'mouseout'({state}) => {
    state.hovered.set(false);
  }
};
```

### Event Binding Example

In the following example events are attached to four separate buttons to control the size of the shape.

## Special Event Keywords

Keywords are special preceding terms that modify how events are attached permitting you to bind events to elements other than those found in your [component's template](/templates).

### Global

You can use the `global` keyword to attach an event globally to any element outside of your component.

For instance this can be used with global events like `scroll` or `hashchange`

```javascript
const events = {
  'global scroll window'() => {
    // page scrolled
  }
};
```

### Deep

You can use the `deep` keyword to attach events to nested web components or slotted content. The deep content may be a nested web component or slotted content.

> **Deep Usage** - By default selectors will only match the DOM of your component's template. This will prevent the handler from firing if the user slots content which also matches your selectors.

```html
<ui-button>Submit</ui-button>
```

```javascript
const events = {
  'deep .button .icon'() => {
    // the icon on a button is clicked
  }
};
```

## Event Data

In many cases you want to access data particular to an event. Event handlers can use `data` to achieve this.

### HTML Metadata

HTML metadata can be added using data attributes and will be available directly from the data object

```html
<div class="increment" data-amount="1">Increment 1</div>
<div class="increment" data-amount="10">Increment 10</div>
```

```javascript
const events = {
  'click .increment'({self, data]}) {
    self.increment(data.amount);
  }
};
```

### Custom Event Data

Any custom event metadata will also be available in the `data` attribute.

Another component creates an event
```
const createInstance = ({dispatchEvent}) {
  startResize() {
    dispatchEvent('resizeStart', {
      startPosition: currentPosition,
    });
  }
}
```

Your component's listens to the event
```javascript
const events = {
  'resizeStart custom-component'({data}) {
    // data is { startPosition }
  },
};
```

### Data Example

In the following example html data attributes control whether the width or height is mutated and whether it is growing or shrinking.

## Advanced Use Cases

In some scenarios you may want to manually bind and unbind events that are part of your components lifecycle.


### Binding Events Dynamically

You can use `attachEvent` which is passed to all component callbacks to attach events dynamically where you may not know the selector until the component is created

> All events attached with `attachEvent` will automatically be removed when the component is destroyed using `abortSignals`.

```javascript
const onCreated = ({attachEvent, settings, isClient}) => {
  if(isClient) {
    attachEvent(settings.scrollContext, 'scroll', self.onPageScroll)
  }
};
```

### Manually Removing Events

When you use `attachEvent` it will return an event handler that you can use to unbind an event later using `off`


```javascript
const onCreated = ({attachEvent, $, isClient}) => {
  const handler = attachEvent('body', 'click', () => {
    console.log('You clicked me');
  })
  $('body').off('click', handler)
};
```

## Creating Events

### Dispatching Custom Events

Custom events can be emitted from your component using `dispatchEvent` and can include custom metadata which will be passed along as `data` to events.

```javascript
const createInstance = ({dispatchEvent}) => {
  scrollToItem(itemID) {
    // handle scrolling to item
    dispatchEvent('itemactive', { itemID, position });
  },
};
```


> **Callbacks versus events** Although you can use callback functions in [component settings](/component/settings) to alert of internal changes in a component, it is a better pattern to only use callbacks in settings if you need the function to return a value as dispatched events cannot achieve this.

```javascript
const settings = {

  // this could be useful to allow user to cancel an internal action
  shouldShow: () => true,

  // this should probably be a custom event
  onShow: function(){},
};
```



### Listening to Custom Events
You can listen to a custom event the same way as a normal browser event, however they can include additional metadata.

```javascript
// from another component
const events = {
  'itemactive inpage-menu'({self, data}) {
    const { itemID, position } = data;
    // do something with metadata
  }
};
```

You can also use [query](/query) to listen to custom events from your component
```javascript
import { $ } from '@semantic-ui/query';

$('inpage-menu', 'itemactive', (event) => {
  const { itemID, position } = event.details;
  // do something with metadata
})
```

Or simply use vanilla javascript
```javascript
const el = document.querySelector('inpage-menu');
el.addEventListener('itemactive', (event) => {
  const { itemID, position } = event.details;
});
```

## Built In Events

### Lifecycle Events
You can listen to any [components lifecycle events](/components/lifecycle) with event listeners similar to Components all emit lifecycle events as native DOM events that can be used to respond to the lifecycle of subcomponents.

The custom event will also include a reference to the component which you can use to invoke behaviors on that component.

```javascript
const events = {
  'rendered inpage-menu'({self, data}) {
    // component lifecycle event passes through component instance at data
    const menu = data.component;
    menu.setActive();
  }
  'destroyed inpage-menu'() {
    // menu component is destroyed
  }
};
```

## Event Handlers

In addition to the [standard arguments](/components/lifecycle) that are passed to all component callbacks, event handlers get access to a few extra arguments.

| parameter         | use                                                   |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| el                | the dom element that dispatched the event             |
| event             | the native event object                               |
| data              | event.detail + data attributes on dom element         |
| isDeep            | the event occurred on a nested web coomponent or slot |
