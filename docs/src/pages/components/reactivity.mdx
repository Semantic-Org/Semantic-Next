This guide focuses primarily on reactivity in the context of components.

> **Signals** - Semantic UI uses a signals based approach for reactivity. This works by tracking references to reactive variables and then running a flush which triggers those reactions after their values change. For more information see our dedicated section on [reactivity](/reactivity).

## Sources of Reactivity


### Reactive Data

Reactivity occurs when a reactive value is modified inside of a reactive context. If you want a value to render reactively, you must have **both a reactive value and a reactive context**.


#### Reactive Data Sources
* State
* Settings
* ReactiveVar

#### Reactive Data Contexts
* Template Conditionals
* Template Loops
* Template Expressions
* `Reaction` created inside your component

### Non-Reactive Data

If you want to use or set a variable without triggering reactivity **either a value or context must be non-reactive**.

#### Non-Reactive Data Sources
* DOM Elements or Properties
* Properties set on your component
* `$` or `$$` DOM Query Collections

#### Non-Reactive Data Contexts
* Component Methods
* Lifecycle Callbacks
* Event & Keyboard Handlers

> **Avoiding Reactivity** - You can access reactive values with `peek` to avoid reactivity, and use `Reaction.nonreactive` to control the reactivity of a function.For more information see [controlling reactivity](/reactivity/controls).


## Component Reactivity

### State Reactivity

Your component's `state` is the internal store of reactivity for your component. When your component is initialized each `state` property will become a [`reactiveVar`](/reactivity/variables) and will trigger reactivity inside a `Reaction`.

```javascript
const state = {
  counter: 0;
}

const onCreated = ({state, reaction}) {
  reaction(() => {
    // counter will not update when the value changes below
    console.log(`Count: ${state.counter.get()}`);
  });
  // update value
  state.counter.increment();
}
```

State will also trigger reactivity in your template.
```html
Counter is: {{counter}}
```


### Settings Reactivity

Settings are **not reactive inside a `reaction`** because they are not instances of `reactiveVar`.

```javascript
const settings = {
  counter: 0;
}

const onCreated = ({settings, reaction}) {
  reaction(() => {
    // counter will not update when the value changes below
    console.log(`Count: ${settings.counter}`);
  });
  // update value
  settings.counter++;
}
```

However  **settings are reactive inside templates**, and will trigger updates when their underlying value changes.
```html
Counter is: {{counter}}
```


### Template Reactivity

Reactive variables can be accessed from inside a template without calling its `get` or `value` helper.

```html
<ul>
  {{#each item in items}}
    <li>{{item}}</li>
  {{/each}}
</ul>
```

Expressions, loops, and conditionals are reactive contexts by default. If `items` in this example grows the results will update automatically.

```html
<ul>
  {{#if hasAny items}}
    Has items
  {{else}}
    No items
  {{/if}}
</ul>
```

## Advanced Use


All [lifecycle events and callbacks](/components/lifecycle) will return `reactiveVar` and
`reaction`. These can be used to create scoped reactions that will be tied to the component's lifecycle, and automatically torn down when the component is destroyed.


### Exposing Reactivity

You can expose a `reactiveVar` on your component instance to allow other components to rely on it as a source of reactivity. This can be a useful way to share reactivity across related parts of your app.

> Component `state` and `settings` are not accessible outside your component unless they are exposed on your component instance.


```javascript title="todo.js"
const createComponent = ({ self, reactiveVar, reaction }) => {
  return {
    todos: reactiveVar([]),
  };
};
```

```javascript title="todo-item.js"
const createComponent = ({ findParent }) => {
  getTodos() {
    const todoList = findParent('todoList');
    return todoList.todos.get();
  }
};
```



### Reducing Reactivity

Template expressions are reactive by default but this might not always be ideal. Template reactivity can be removed by using the `nonreactive` helper

```html
<ul>
  {{#each item in nonreactive items}}
    {{item}}
  {{/each}}
</ul>
