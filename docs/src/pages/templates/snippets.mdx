### Snippets
Snippets are a special kind of subtemplate that are defined inline for convenience.

### Creating Snippets

Snippets are similar to [subtemplates](templates/subtemplates) but can be defined in the same file as where they are used.

```handlebars
{{#snippet hello}}
  Hello World
{{/snippet}}

{{> hello}} {{>hello}}
```

### Data Context

By default a snippet inherits its parents data context, but you can modify its data context by passing in data

```handlebars
{{#snippet greeting}}
  {{greeting}} {{name}}
{{/snippet}}

{{> greeting greeting='hello' name='Sally'}}
{{> greeting greeting='goodbye' name='Sally'}}
```

#### Snippet Example

This example shows a common pattern of using a snippet to define a table row

<PlaygroundExample id="snippets" direction="horizontal"></PlaygroundExample>
