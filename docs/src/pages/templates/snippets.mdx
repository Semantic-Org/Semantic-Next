### Snippets
Snippets are a special kind of subtemplate that are defined inline. Snippets are useful when multiple portions of a single template should reference the same logic or structure.


### Creating Snippets

Snippets are similar to [subtemplates](templates/subtemplates) but can be defined in the same file as where they are used.

Snippets are defined using the syntax
```handlebars
{#snippet snippetName}
  Snippet Content
{/snippet}
```

A common use of a snippet is to repeat portions of a template in two locations, for instance to display some content as a link if `href` is defined.

> **Snippet Location** - Snippets are not dependent on the order they are included and can be defined either before and after where they are invoked.

```handlebars
{#if href}
  <a href={href}>
    {>content}
  </a>
{else}
  {>content}
{/if}

{#snippet content}
  {beforeText} {text} {afterText}
{/snippet}

```

### Data Context

By default a snippet inherits its parents data context, but you can modify its data context by passing in data

```handlebars
{#snippet greeting}
  {greeting} {name}
{/snippet}

{> greeting greeting='hello' name='Sally'}
{> greeting greeting='goodbye' name='Sally'}
```

#### Snippet Example

This example shows a common pattern of using a snippet to define a table row

<PlaygroundExample id="snippets" direction="horizontal"></PlaygroundExample>
