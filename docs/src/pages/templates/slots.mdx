## Using Slots

Slots allow your component to expose locations that can receive arbitrary html. This is very useful to expose portions of your component to be built into.

### Default Slot

Using the syntax `{>slot}` without a name will create a default slot which will allow all html nested inside a web component to be slotted.

```handlbars
{> slot}
```
```html
<my-component>
  <p>This content is slotted</p>
</my-component>
```

### Named Slot

Named slots allow content that is specified with same name for `slot` to be slotted when a component is used.

Template
```handlebars
<div class="card">
  <div class="header">
    {> slot name="header"}
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    {> slot name="content"}
  </div>
</div>
```
HTML
```html
<ui-card>
  <div slot="header">Johnny Montana</div>
  <div slot="content">
    <p>Johnny was a cowboy, the best we ever had.</p>
    <p>He rode through the wilderness day and night.</p>
  </div>
</ui-card>
```


## Slots vs Settings

Depending on your use case you might consider using a `slot` or a setting which is passed through using an html `attribute` or `property`.

Both allow you to pass simple string contents into your component however there are advantages and drawbacks to each approach

> **Server Side Rendering with Slots** - Slotted content can make achieving full server side rendering more difficult unless you are cautious of how you access slotted content from inside your component. For more information see our [dedicated section on server side rendering](/ssr).

### Settings

#### Pros
* Components have access to the value of `settings` meaning they can provide alternative content if the values are empty.
* `settings` are defined on the server, which means they can be rendered using SSR

#### Cons
* May not be as SEO friendly for web crawlers
* Passing through HTML requires serializing data and properly handling script injection
* Requires defining `part` to expose them to the component

### Slots

#### Pros
* Slots allow nested html to be passed through to a component
* Slots are easy to style from page css without `part` syntax

#### Cons
* Slotted content is not available in a template data context, meaning they cant be used for expressions like conditionals. i.e. `{#if slottedContent}`
* Slotted content is unavailable during server side rendering
* Slotted content is harder to style from inside a component `::slotted` pseudo selector does not work with other css selectors like `:first-child`
