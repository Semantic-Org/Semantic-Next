## What is Semantic UI?

Semantic UI is a UI framework built for authoring websites using [web components](/web-components) with signals based reactivity, an expressive shadow DOM templating syntax, robust theming using css layers and  variables, and an integrated underlying UI component framework that  supports SSR by default.

#### Key Features
* Uses **native browser standards** which means it **can run without a compilation step** unlike many modern JS frameworks.
* Built on a [reactive component framework](/components) that you can use to author your own web components.
* [Modern css theming](/theming) using **thousands of CSS variables**, **cascading inheritance layers** to make overrides easy, **dark mode aware** components and **em based** scaling.
* UI components support [server side rendering with hydration](/ssr) out of the box.

### Built To Scale

Semantic uses web components which are a native browser standard meaning your codebase will never grow stale when a new framework comes out. It also means that you can use Semantic inside other frameworks that support web components like React, Vue or Svelte.


### What's Included

Semantic includes the following core libraries:
* An underlying [UI component framework](/components) that includes things like popups, dropdowns, modals, and form controls.
* A robust [reactive templating language](/templating) that compiles to web components.
* A signals based [reactivity library](/reactivity).
* A modern 3kb jQuery-like replacement called [Query](/query) to handle DOM APIs
* A higly-performant [rendering engine](/rendering) powered by [Lit](https://lit.dev) under the hood.


## Coding With Semantic

Semantic is written to read like english, which makes working with a codebase written in Semantic UI easy and intuitive

```html
<ui-menu selection evenly-spaced>
  <menu-item value="a">Choice A</menu-item>
  <menu-item value="b">Choice B</menu-item>
  <menu-item value="c">Choice C</menu-item>
</ui-menu>
```

Semantic also includes some **concepts from natural language like plurality** to make inheritance easy to understand.

```html
<ui-buttons large>
  <ui-button>Cancel</ui-button>
  <ui-button primary>Submit</ui-button>
</ui-buttons>
```

### Theming

Semantic theming is **light/dark mode aware** and can be used to create your own web components or just style parts of your page.

```css
.my-element {
  /* think in terms of words not pixels. compact means 0.5em */
  padding: var(--compact-spacing);

  /* border is dark in light mode and light in dark mode */
  border: var(--border;);

  /* standard 70% means 70% black in light mode and 70% white in dark mode */
  color: var(--standard-70);
}
```


### Building Apps

For companies using Semantic you can also consider using our [component framework](/components) to build out your entire app with web components.
