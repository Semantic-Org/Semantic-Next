## What is Semantic UI?

Semantic UI is a UI framework built for authoring websites using [web components](/web-components) with signals based reactivity, an expressive shadow DOM templating syntax, robust theming using css layers and  variables, and an integrated underlying UI component framework that  supports SSR by default.

### Key Features

Semantic includes the following core libraries:
* An underlying [UI component framework](/components) that includes things like popups, dropdowns, modals, and form controls.
* A robust [reactive templating language](/templates) that compiles to web components.
* A signals based [reactivity library](/reactivity).
* A modern 3kb jQuery-like replacement called [Query](/query) to handle DOM APIs
* A higly-performant [rendering engine](/rendering) powered by [Lit](https://lit.dev) under the hood.
