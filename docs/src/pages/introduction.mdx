The two main ways to use Semantic UI
* **Creating UI Components** - Semantic provides all the tools to build robust feature-rich UI with web components, whether your goal is to build an in-house design system, build a website, or contribute UI components to the open source community.
* **Using UI Components** - Semantic provides an out of the box set of ui components similar to the original version or other UI frameworks

> Semantic UI's component framework is designed to provide the missing toolkit to make web components easy to author and ship at scale, with features like reactivity, templating, tools for events and keybindings, and a robust css framework for styling.


## Creating UI Components

Semantic provides several core libraries to make it easy to ship custom UI as web components.

</UICards>


## Using UI Components

If you prefer to use Semantic UI purely as a UI framework and not author your own custom UI, you can simply use web components directly wherever you write your code from `@semantic-ui/core`

<UICard horizontal
  header="@semantic-ui/core"
  icon="layers"
  href="/usage"
  description="A robust set of primitives that provide components like card, button, menu, input, modal and more."
></UICard>
