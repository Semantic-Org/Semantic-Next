## What is Semantic UI?

Semantic is a UI framework that helps you create beautiful websites fast by creating markup that is easy to read and semantically meaningful.


#### Tech Features

* [Modern css theming](/theming) using **cascading inheritance layers**, **dark mode** and **em based** scaling.
* Supports [server side rendering](/ssr) with hydration out of the box.
* Built with [web components](/web-components) so you can take your UI with you even if you change  frameworks.

#### What's Inside

Semantic includes the following core libraries:
* An underlying [component framework](/component) that renders to web components.
* A high level [templating](/templating) language with **built in signals support**.
* A signals based [reactivity library](/reactivity).
* A modern 3kb jQuery-like replacement called [Query](/query).
* A robust [rendering engine](/rendering) powered by [Lit](https://lit.dev) under the hood.


The core of Semantic UI are a set of themeable web components that let you easily and quickly design applications.

### A Natural Approach to Code

Semantic UI is built using natural language which means components are easy to read and modify.

It transforms your front end code from a set of heiroglyphics to something that describe the interface elements in a layout.

### Machine Interpretable

Semantic UI components are all built using an underlying JSON specification. This specification outlines components in a way that is machine-interpretable and can be used to build robust developer or internal tooling.
