## What is Semantic UI?

Semantic is a web-component based UI framework that supports SSR out of the box. Semantic uses naming based around concepts from natural language, that makes your html easy to read and semantically meaningful.

Semantic is built with [web components](/web-components) a core web technology that allows you to take your UI with you even if you change between your front-end javascript frameworks.


#### Tech Features

* [Modern css theming](/theming) using **cascading inheritance layers**, **dark mode** and **em based** scaling.
* UI components support [server side rendering with hydration](/ssr) out of the box.
* Provides a [reactive web component framework](/templates) to build your own web components


#### What's Inside

Semantic includes the following core libraries:
* An underlying [UI component framework](/component) that includes things like popups, dropdowns, modals, and form controls.
* A robust [reactive templating language](/templating) that compiles to web components.
* A signals based [reactivity library](/reactivity).
* A modern 3kb jQuery-like replacement called [Query](/query) to handle DOM APIs
* A higly-performant [rendering engine](/rendering) powered by [Lit](https://lit.dev) under the hood.

### Machine Interpretable

Semantic UI components are all built using an underlying JSON specification. This specification outlines components in a way that is machine-interpretable and can be used to build robust developer or internal tooling.
