Semantic UI is designed to be an interchange format for UI components that wraps web components adding in the missing features necessary to ship UI using web components.


You can choose to adopt Semantic UI to author your entire app or website using web components or simply use web components as an end-user integrating them into another codebase written in HTML or in many other frameworks like React, Svelte, Angular that natively support web components.

## Create Components

If you choose to use Semantic UI entirely, you can use the [component framework](/components) to create custom components which render to web components, which you can use directly in your layout as HTML similar to the in-house UI primitives.

</UICards>


## Use Components

If you prefer to use Semantic UI purely as a UI framework and not author your own custom UI, you can simply use web components directly wherever you write your code from `@semantic-ui/core`

<UICard horizontal
  header="@semantic-ui/core"
  icon="layers"
  href="/usage"
  description="A robust set of primitives that provide components like card, button, menu, input, modal and more."
></UICard>
