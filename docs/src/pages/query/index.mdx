## What is Query

Query is a library used for accessing the DOM of the page specifically built to make dealing with web components simpler **that is less than 10kb**.

It implements the most useful parts of a traditional jQuery like chainable API but is built to use only modern techniques like `AbortController` for removing events, `CustomEvents` for dispatching events from web components and much more.


## Installation

You can install Query using npm

```bash
npm install @semantic-ui/query
```

## Usage


### Standard

Query provides two exports `$` and `$$` for querying the DOM
```javascript
import { $ } from '@semantic-ui/query';
const $div = $('div');
```

### Shadow Piercing

Query provides a separate export `$$` for piercing the shadow DOM. This is the same as passing `pierceShadow: true` as an option to `$` but is provided for convenience as a separate export.

> Piercing shadow DOM boundaries requires recursive tree traversal and is slightly less performant than `$` which can use native `querySelectorAll` naively--this is why this behavior is opt-in.

```javascript
import { $, $$ } from '@semantic-ui/query';

// these are equivalent
const $div = $$('my-component div');
const $div = $('my-component div', { pierceShadow: true});
```

### Browser

In a browser environment you can use `exportGlobals` to export $ and $$ for use in your page. For more fina graned control see the [browser helpers](#browser-helpers) section below

```javascript
import { exportGlobals } from '@semantic-ui/query';

// make $ and $$ available globally
exportGlobals();
```

### Components

`$` and `$$` are integrated into all lifecycle callbacks and events in Semantic UI components.

```javascript
const createInstance = ({$, $$}) => ({
  getDiv() {
    return $('div').get(0);
  }
});
```

```javascript
const onCreated = ({$, $$}) => {
  const $div = $('div');
};
```

```javascript
const events =  {
  'click div'({$ , $$}) {
    const $div = $('div').trigger('click');
  }
};
```

## Browser Helpers

A few additional helpers are provided specifically for using Query in browser environments.

### Restoring Globals
If you need to restore the previous values before calling export globals.
```javascript
import { exportGlobals, restoreGlobals } from '@semantic-ui/query';

// $ and $$ are defined
exportGlobals();

// $ and $$ are now their original values
restoreGlobals();
```

### Custom Alias
You can also choose to use Query as a custom alias
```javascript
import { useAlias } from '@semantic-ui/query';

const myQuery = useAlias();
const $div = myQuery('div');
```
