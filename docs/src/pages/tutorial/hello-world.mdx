To create a new component in Semantic UI you pass in a set of arguments to `defineComponent` which help define aspects of how your component functions. In the most simple case you only need to specify what HTML will be rendered for your component.

```javascript
const counter = defineComponent({
  template: '<p>Hello World</p>',
});
```


### Defining a Web Component

If a `tagName` is specified the component will become a web component and be defined automatically meaning you can render the component simply by using the tag.

```javascript
const counter = defineComponent({
  tagName: 'hello-world'
  template: '<p>Hello World</p>',
});
```

```html
<hello-world></hello-world>
```

In most cases you will want to expose some settings so that other users can modify your component. Let's take the simple example of a counter.
