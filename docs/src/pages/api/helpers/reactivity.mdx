Reactivity helpers provide utilities for controlling and debugging reactive behavior in templates.

## Functions

### guard
Ensures that a computation only reruns when its result actually changes, optimizing performance by reducing unnecessary updates.

#### Template Syntax
```sui
{guard expression}
```

#### Parameters
| Name       | Type     | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| expression | any      | The expression to guard |

#### Returns
The result of the guarded expression.

#### Example
```sui
<div>
  Expensive computation result: {guard expensiveFunction someValue anotherValue}
</div>
```

> Note: Use `guard` when you want to prevent unnecessary re-computations of expensive operations. It's particularly useful for optimizing performance in reactive contexts.

### nonreactive
Prevents reactive updates on the wrapped expression. Useful when you want to access values without creating dependencies.

#### Template Syntax
```sui
{nonreactive expression}
```

#### Parameters
| Name       | Type     | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| expression | any      | The expression to make non-reactive |

#### Returns
The result of the non-reactive expression.

#### Example
```sui
<div>
  Static value: {nonreactive someFunction staticValue}
  Reactive value: {someReactiveValue}
</div>
```

> Note: Use `nonreactive` when you need to access a value without creating a dependency in a reactive computation. This can be useful for optimizing your template's reactivity.

### debugReactivity
Debugs reactivity by logging the current reaction source and triggering the debugger. This is particularly useful for understanding which reactive dependencies triggered a re-computation.

#### Template Syntax
```sui
{debugReactivity}
```

#### Parameters
None

#### Returns
`undefined`

#### Example
```sui
<div>
  <p>Total: {total}</p>
  {debugReactivity}
  <p>Items: {items.length}</p>
</div>
```

> Note: `debugReactivity` provides detailed information about the current reactive computation. It can be extremely helpful in tracking down unexpected re-renders or understanding the flow of reactivity in your application.

These reactivity helpers are powerful tools for optimizing and debugging reactive computations in your templates. They interact directly with the underlying reactivity system, providing fine-grained control and insights into your application's reactive behavior.
