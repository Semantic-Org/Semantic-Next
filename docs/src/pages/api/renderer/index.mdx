description: API reference for Semantic UI's rendering engine
---

These docs provide a reference to how template `AST` are rendered to the DOM for UI components.

Semantic currently uses [Google's Lit](https://www.lit.dev) as its primary rendering engine, with the possibility of supporting other rendering targets in the future.

## Installation

The renderer is included as part of the component package:

```bash
npm install @semantic-ui/component
```

## API Sections

* [Lit Renderer](/api/renderer/lit-renderer) - Core rendering engine based on Lit
* [Lit Directives](/api/renderer/lit-directives) - Custom directives for reactive rendering

## Basic Usage

```javascript
import { LitRenderer } from '@semantic-ui/component';

const renderer = new LitRenderer({
  ast: templateAST,
  data: {
    user: { name: 'John' }
  },
  template: parentTemplate
});

const html = renderer.render();
```
