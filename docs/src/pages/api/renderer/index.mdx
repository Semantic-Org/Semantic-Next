---

The Semantic UI Renderer system provides the core templating and rendering functionality for UI components. It currently uses Lit as its primary rendering engine, with the possibility of supporting other rendering targets in the future.

## Installation

The renderer is included as part of the component package:

```bash
npm install @semantic-ui/component
```

## API Sections

* [Lit Renderer](/api/renderer/lit-renderer) - Core rendering engine based on Lit
* [Lit Directives](/api/renderer/lit-directives) - Custom directives for reactive rendering

## Basic Usage

```javascript
import { LitRenderer } from '@semantic-ui/component';

const renderer = new LitRenderer({
  ast: templateAST,
  data: {
    user: { name: 'John' }
  },
  template: parentTemplate
});

const html = renderer.render();
```
