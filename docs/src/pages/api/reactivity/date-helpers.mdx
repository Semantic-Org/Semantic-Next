Date Helpers are methods available on ReactiveVar instances that contain Date objects. These helpers provide a convenient way to update the date value reactively.

## now

Sets the value of the ReactiveVar to the current date and time.

### Syntax
```javascript
reactiveVar.now()
```

### Returns

Date - The new Date object representing the current date and time.

### Usage

```javascript
import { ReactiveVar } from '@semantic-ui/reactivity';

const currentTime = new ReactiveVar(new Date());

console.log(currentTime.get()); // Output: current date and time

// After some time...
currentTime.now();
console.log(currentTime.get()); // Output: updated current date and time
```

### Notes

- The `now()` method is particularly useful when you need to update a reactive date variable to the current time, such as for timestamps or when refreshing time-based data.
- Remember that like all ReactiveVar modifications, using `now()` will trigger any reactive computations that depend on this variable.
- The returned Date object represents the time at which `now()` was called, not when it's later accessed.
