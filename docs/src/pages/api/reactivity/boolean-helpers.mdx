Boolean Helpers are methods available on Signal instances that contain boolean values. These helpers provide a convenient way to toggle the state of a boolean reactive variable.

## toggle

Switches the boolean value of the Signal to its opposite state.

### Syntax
```javascript
signal.toggle()
```

### Returns

boolean - The new value after toggling.

### Usage

```javascript
import { Signal } from '@semantic-ui/reactivity';

const isActive = new Signal(false);
isActive.toggle();
```

### Example
<PlaygroundExample id="reactive-toggle" direction="horizontal"></PlaygroundExample>

### Notes

- The `toggle()` method is particularly useful for managing binary states in your application, such as showing/hiding elements, enabling/disabling features, or switching between two modes.
- It provides a clean and readable way to flip boolean states without explicitly checking and setting the opposite value.
- Remember that like all Signal modifications, using `toggle()` will trigger any reactive computations that depend on this variable.
