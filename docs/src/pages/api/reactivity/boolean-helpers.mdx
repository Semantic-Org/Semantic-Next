Boolean Helpers are methods available on ReactiveVar instances that contain boolean values. These helpers provide a convenient way to toggle the state of a boolean reactive variable.

## toggle

Switches the boolean value of the ReactiveVar to its opposite state.

### Syntax
```javascript
reactiveVar.toggle()
```

### Returns

boolean - The new value after toggling.

### Usage

```javascript
import { ReactiveVar } from '@semantic-ui/reactivity';

const isActive = new ReactiveVar(false);

console.log(isActive.get()); // Output: false

isActive.toggle();
console.log(isActive.get()); // Output: true

isActive.toggle();
console.log(isActive.get()); // Output: false
```

### Notes

- The `toggle()` method is particularly useful for managing binary states in your application, such as showing/hiding elements, enabling/disabling features, or switching between two modes.
- It provides a clean and readable way to flip boolean states without explicitly checking and setting the opposite value.
- Remember that like all ReactiveVar modifications, using `toggle()` will trigger any reactive computations that depend on this variable.
