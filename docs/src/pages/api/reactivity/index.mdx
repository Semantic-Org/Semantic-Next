title: Reactivity with Signals
description: Learn how Semantic UI uses signals to produce reactivity
---

## Introduction

Reactivity provides primitives for a signals based reactivity system. It is used internally to power templating and rendering components, but can also be used as reactivity primitives for any custom project.

## Installation

Reactivity can be used as a standalone package or alongside [Semantic UI components](/components).

```bash
npm install @semantic-ui/reactivity
```

## What's Inside

### Data Type Helpers

Semantic UI includes various helpers to make it easy to manipulate data like arrays, records (arrays of objects), counters, toggles, and streamline data manipulation.

##### Number Helpers
- `increment(amount)`, `decrement(amount)` - increments by amount

##### Boolean Helper
- `toggle()` - toggles from `false` to `true`

##### Array Mutation Helpers
- `push()`, `unshift()`, `splice()` - same as native but reactive
- `setIndex(index, value)` - Sets value at index
- `removeIndex(index)` - Remove index
- `setArrayProperty(indexOrProp, property, value)` - Set property at index or across all

##### Record Helpers (Array of Objects)
- `setProperty(id, property, value)` - set property on item matching id
- `replaceItem(item, id)` - replace item matching id
- `removeItem(id)` - Remove a specific item from array by id
- `getIndex(id)` - get index from id
- `getID(index)` - get id at an index
- `hasID(index)` - checks if index has an id

##### Date Helpers
- `now` - Set to current time


You can learn more about this in the documentation for [array helpers](#), [record helpers](), [date helpers](), and [boolean helpers]().
