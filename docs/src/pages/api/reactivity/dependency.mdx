description: API reference for Dependency in Semantic UI's reactivity system
---

`Dependency` is a core class in Semantic UI's reactivity system that manages dependencies between reactive computations and data sources.

> **Advanced Use Only** - Dependency **should not be used by most developers directly** to control dependencies, but is instead used internally by `ReactiveVar` and `Reaction` to establish reactivity. Only some particular advanced use cases or metaframeworks will need to access this class directly.

## constructor

Creates a new Dependency instance.

### Syntax
```javascript
new Dependency()
```

### Usage

```javascript
import { Dependency } from '@semantic-ui/reactivity';

const dep = new Dependency();
```

## depend

Registers the current reaction as dependent on this Dependency.

### Syntax
```javascript
dependency.depend()
```

### Usage

```javascript
import { Dependency, Reaction } from '@semantic-ui/reactivity';

const dep = new Dependency();

Reaction.create(() => {
  dep.depend();
  console.log('This will re-run when dep.changed() is called');
});
```

## changed

Notifies all dependent reactions that this dependency has changed, causing them to re-run.

### Syntax
```javascript
dependency.changed(context)
```

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| context | any | (Optional) Additional context information to pass to invalidated reactions |

### Usage

```javascript
import { Dependency, Reaction } from '@semantic-ui/reactivity';

const dep = new Dependency();

Reaction.create(() => {
  dep.depend();
  console.log('Reaction ran');
});

dep.changed(); // Triggers the reaction to re-run
```

## cleanUp

Removes a specific reaction from this dependency's list of dependents.

### Syntax
```javascript
dependency.cleanUp(reaction)
```

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| reaction | Reaction | The reaction to remove from the dependency list |

### Usage

```javascript
import { Dependency, Reaction } from '@semantic-ui/reactivity';

const dep = new Dependency();

const reaction = Reaction.create(() => {
  dep.depend();
  console.log('Reaction ran');
});

// Later, when you want to remove this specific reaction:
dep.cleanUp(reaction);
```

## unsubscribe

Alias for `cleanUp`. Removes a specific reaction from this dependency's list of dependents.

### Syntax
```javascript
dependency.unsubscribe(reaction)
```

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| reaction | Reaction | The reaction to unsubscribe from the dependency |

### Usage

```javascript
import { Dependency, Reaction } from '@semantic-ui/reactivity';

const dep = new Dependency();

const reaction = Reaction.create(() => {
  dep.depend();
  console.log('Reaction ran');
});

// Later, when you want to unsubscribe this specific reaction:
dep.unsubscribe(reaction);
```
