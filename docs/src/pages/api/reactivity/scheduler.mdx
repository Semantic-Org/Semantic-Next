description: API reference for Scheduler in Semantic UI's reactivity system
---

`Scheduler` is a core class in Semantic UI's reactivity system that manages the scheduling and execution of reactive computations. It handles the queueing and flushing of reactions, ensuring efficient updates when reactive dependencies change.

The Scheduler class is responsible for:
- Managing the execution of reactive computations
- Ensuring reactions run in the correct order
- Providing debugging information
- Handling the microtask queue for reaction scheduling
- Managing post-flush callbacks


> **Advanced Use Only** Scheduler is primarily used internally by `Signal` and `Reaction`. Most developers should not need to interact with it directly unless building advanced reactive systems or meta-frameworks.

## Static Properties

### current

The currently executing reaction.

#### Syntax
```javascript
Scheduler.current
```

#### Returns

Reaction | null - The currently executing reaction, or null if no reaction is executing.

#### Usage

```javascript
import { Scheduler } from '@semantic-ui/reactivity';

console.log(Scheduler.current); // null if outside a reaction
```

### pendingReactions

Set of reactions waiting to be executed.

#### Syntax
```javascript
Scheduler.pendingReactions
```

#### Returns

Set - The set of pending reactions.

## Static Methods

### scheduleReaction

Schedules a reaction to be executed during the next flush cycle.

#### Syntax
```javascript
Scheduler.scheduleReaction(reaction)
```

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| reaction | Reaction | The reaction to schedule for execution |

#### Usage

```javascript
import { Scheduler, Reaction } from '@semantic-ui/reactivity';

const reaction = Reaction.create(() => {
  console.log('Reaction executed');
});

Scheduler.scheduleReaction(reaction);
```

### scheduleFlush

Schedules a flush of all pending reactions using the microtask queue.

#### Syntax
```javascript
Scheduler.scheduleFlush()
```

#### Usage

```javascript
import { Scheduler } from '@semantic-ui/reactivity';

Scheduler.scheduleFlush();
```

### flush

Immediately executes all pending reactions and afterFlush callbacks.

#### Syntax
```javascript
Scheduler.flush()
```

#### Usage

```javascript
import { Scheduler } from '@semantic-ui/reactivity';

Scheduler.flush(); // Executes all pending reactions immediately
```

### afterFlush

Registers a callback to be executed after the next flush cycle completes.

#### Syntax
```javascript
Scheduler.afterFlush(callback)
```

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| callback | Function | Function to execute after flush completes |

#### Usage

```javascript
import { Scheduler } from '@semantic-ui/reactivity';

Scheduler.afterFlush(() => {
  console.log('Flush completed');
});
```

### getSource

Returns the stack trace of the current reaction for debugging purposes.

#### Syntax
```javascript
Scheduler.getSource()
```

#### Returns

string | undefined - The stack trace of the current reaction, or undefined if no reaction is running.

#### Usage

```javascript
import { Scheduler, Reaction } from '@semantic-ui/reactivity';

Reaction.create(() => {
  console.log(Scheduler.getSource());
});
```
