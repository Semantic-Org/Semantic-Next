### Purpose of SSR

When a webpage is loaded custom tags are upgraded, this means to have content on initial load that matches the final styling you will need to use an SSR solution.

Without SSR you will see a flash of unstyled content when the UI component is upgraded to its final rendered shadow DOM.
