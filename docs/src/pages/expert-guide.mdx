## Technicalities

Semantic UI are web components designed using an underlying reactive framework to avoid many of the common pitfalls and dead-ends when creating custom web components.

### Shadow DOM

Web components construct their Shadow DOM using a bespoke templating language called `Semantic Component Markup (SCM)`.

This is designed to make it easy to write code that binds reactively to data in a web component, allowing for reactive control structures, partials with shared data contexts and much more.


### Semantic Component Markup

Semantic component markup is a templating language that renders to an `AST`. Semantic includes a render for compiling this `AST` to `Lit` which can be used to create web components, but other renderers could be made in the future to render to other endpoints.
