## Technicalities

Semantic UI are web components designed using an underlying reactive framework to avoid many of the common pitfalls and dead-ends when creating custom web components.

Web components construct their Shadow DOM using a bespoke templating language called `Semantic Component Markup (SCM)`.

This is designed to make it easy to write code that binds reactively to data in a web component, allowing for reactive control structures, partials with shared data contexts and much more.
