Reactivity relies on dependency tracking and for complex reactive patterns there can be a performance overhead of spurious reactivity.

Semantic provides several helpers which can help reduce reactivity by allowing you to control reactive contexts more granularly.


### Guard

Guard is a special type of reactive context that only reruns when the returned value has changed. This can be useful to control triggering downstream reactivity for a reactive value that is dependent on another reactive value.

It can be used to make sure a subcalculation does not trigger a parent calculation if the value doesnt change.
