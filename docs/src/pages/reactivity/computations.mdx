Reactions return a reference to the current `reaction` which can provide additional granular control over reactivity.

### Stopping Reactivity

You may find you want to stop a reaction from occuring at some point after setting it up. Reactions are passed to their callbacks as the first argument and provide a `stop` method for stopping the reaction.


```javascript
Reaction((reaction) => {
  if(someCondition) {
    reaction.stop();
  }
});
```

### First Run Flag

You may need to define special behavior on the first run of a reaction, for instance to setup variables or to skip certain sections of code. You can use `reaction.firstRun` to handle this.

```javascript
Reaction((reaction) => {
  if(reaction.firstRun) {
    // special logic
  }
});
```
