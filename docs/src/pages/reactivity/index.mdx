## Understanding Reactivity

Reactivity put simply is **values changing causes stuff to happen**.

### Signals

Signals are a **mechanism for implementing reactivity** that works by tracking what functions reference a variable. These references are called [dependencies](/api/reactivity/dependency) and are used to track references to update when an underyling value is updated.

To ensure dependencies are properly tracked signals are accessed using a `value` (accessor) or a `get()` function.

### Reactions

The function that re-runs when a signal is changed is called a `Reaction`. When a signal is referenced inside a reaction it will cause the `reaction` to rerun when the value changes.


> **Naming Conventions** - Signals implementations vary in their naming conventions a reactive context is called ***watcher***  in the [signals proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals), a **computation** in [Preact](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals/) and `watch` in [Lit](https://lit.dev/docs/data/signals/).


## Usage


### Standalone
Semantic UI includes a package [`@semantic-ui/reactivity`](/api/reactivity) which exports [`Signal`](/api/reactivity/reactive-var), [`Reaction`](/api/reactivity/reaction), and [`Dependency`](/api/reactivity/dependency) and can be used as a standalone package without using [Semantic UI components](/components).

```javascript
import { Signal, Reaction } from '@semantic-ui/reactivity';

const counter = new Signal(1);

Reaction.create(() => {
  console.log(counter.value);
  // outputs 1 2
});
counter.increment();
```

### Component

If you are using `@semantic-ui/component`, reactivity is [built into templating](/api/templates) and available directly from [lifecycle callbacks](/components/lifecycle#callback-arguments).

You can use `reaction` and `signal` directly from all lifecycle callbacks. Reactions created this way will automatically be tied to the component lifecycle.

> Learn more about reactivity in components in the dedicated [component reactivity](/components/reactivity) section.


```javascript
const createComponent = ({ self, reaction, signal }) => ({
  value: signal(0),
  initialize() {
    // this will log whenever the value updates
    reaction(() => {
      console.log(self.value);
    });
  }
});
```

## Example

### Birthday Calendar

Imagine keeping a birthday calendar for your friends birthdays.

In a signal based reactivity system the current day could be thought of as a **signal**.

Each day you might wake up and notice that the `day` has updated. You can then run a `reaction` to check if any of your friends' birthdays are today.

```javascript
const today = new Signal( new Date() );

// each day when you wake up
const newDay() => {
  today.set(new Date());
}

const checkBirthdays = Reaction(() => {
  const today = today.get();
  each(friendsBirthdays, (birthday) => {
    if(today == birthday) {
      // wish them happy birthday
    }
    else {
      // no birthdays today
    }
  });
}
```
