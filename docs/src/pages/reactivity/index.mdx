### Understanding Signals Based Reactivity

Reactivity put simply is **values changing causes stuff to happen**.

Signals are a **mechanism for implementing reactivity** that works by tracking the dependencies of a reactive value.

This is typically implemented using a `value` accessor or a `get()` function that tracks a reference to each time it is called, then re-runs each dependency when a value changes.

The value that changes is typically called a **signal**.

The function that re-runs when the value changes can be called many different things, for instance a ***watcher***  in the [signals proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals), a **computation** like in [Preact](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals/) or simply `watch` like in [Lit](https://lit.dev/docs/data/signals/).


> **Naming Conventions** - Semantic UI chooses to call a `Signal` a `ReactiveVar` which separates the implementation from the name. The function that changes is simply called a `Reaction`, making it easy to remember that a `ReactiveVar` causes a `Reaction`.

### Usage

Semantic UI includes a package [`@semantic-ui/reactivity`](/api/reactivity) which exports [`ReactiveVar`](/api/reactivity/reactive-var), [`Reaction`](/api/reactivity/reaction), and [`Dependency`](/api/reactivity/dependency) and can be used as a standalone package without using [Semantic UI components](/components).

```javascript
import { ReactiveVar, Reaction } from '@semantic-ui/reactivity';

const counter = new ReactiveVar(1);

Reaction.create(() => {
  console.log(counter.value);
  // outputs 1 2
});
counter.increment();
```

### Usage in Components

If you are using `@semantic-ui/component`, reactivity is [built into templating](/api/templates) and available directly from [lifecycle callbacks](/components/lifecycle#callback-arguments).

> Learn more about reactivity in components in the dedicated [component reactivity](/components/reactivity) section.

## Birthday Example

Imagine keeping a birthday calendar for your friends birthdays. Your friends birthdays on the calendar can be thought of as **dependencies**, they rely on knowing the current date to know if your friend's birthday is today. In a signal based reactivity system you can view the current day as the **signal**.

When you wake up each day, you may look at the calendar and then compare the birthday to the circled birthdays on the calendar. This is like rerunning a calculation in your head.

This calculations is a `reaction` which depends on a source of truth, a signal or `ReactiveVar`.

```javascript
const today = new ReactiveVar( new Date() );

// each day when you wake up
const setToday() => {
  today.set(new Date());
}

const checkBirthdays = Reaction(() => {
  const today = today.get();
  if(today == friendsBirthday) {
    // wish them happy birthday
  }
  else {
    // no birthdays today
  }
}
```
