import PlaygroundExample from '@components/PlaygroundExample/PlaygroundExample.astro';

Reactivity put simply is **values changing causes stuff to happen**.

Signals are a **mechanism for implementing reactivity** that works by tracking dependencies of a reactive value.

This is typically implemented using a `value` accessor or a `get()` function that tracks a reference to each time it is called, then re-runs each dependency when a value changes.

The name for this "rerunning function" can be called a ***watcher*** like in the [signals proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals), or a **computation** like in [Preact](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals/). The value that changes is typically called a **signal**.

> **Signals vs Reaction** Although Semantic UI uses a signals based reactivity system the exported
primitives are called `ReactiveVar` and `Reaction` instead of `Signal` and `Computation` to help convey their underlying purpose as an implementation of a reactivity system.

### Standalone Usage

Semantic UI includes a package [`@semantic-ui/reactivity`](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-Next/tree/main/packages/reactivity) which exports `ReactiveVar`, `Dependency` and `Reaction`.

The reactivity system is implemented as a standalone package and can be used without other parts of the framework.

```javascript
import { ReactiveVar, Reaction } from '@semantic-ui/reactivity';

const counter = new ReactiveVar(1);

Reaction.create(() => {
  console.log(counter.value);
  // outputs 1 2
});
counter.increment();
```

### Usage in Components

If you are using `@semantic-ui/component`, reactivity is [built into templating](/templates) and available directly from [lifecycle callbacks](/components/lifecycle#callback-arguments).

> Learn more about reactivity in components in the dedicated [component reactivity](/components/reactivity) section.

## Birthday Example

Imagine keeping a birthday calendar for your friends birthdays. Your friends birthdays on the calendar can be thought of as **dependencies**, they rely on knowing the current date to know if your friend's birthday is today. In a signal based reactivity system you can view the current day as the **signal**.

When you wake up each day, you may look at the calendar and then compare the birthday to the circled birthdays on the calendar. This is like rerunning a calculation in your head.

This calculations is a `reaction` which depends on a source of truth, a signal or `ReactiveVar`.

```javascript
const today = new ReactiveVar( new Date() );

// each day when you wake up
const setToday() => {
  today.set(new Date());
}

const checkBirthdays = Reaction(() => {
  const today = today.get();
  if(today == friendsBirthday) {
    // wish them happy birthday
  }
  else {
    // no birthdays today
  }
}
```

## What's Inside

### Data Type Helpers

Semantic UI includes various helpers to make it easy to manipulate data like arrays, records (arrays of objects), counters, toggles, and streamline data manipulation.

##### Number Helpers
- `increment(amount)`, `decrement(amount)` - increments by amount

##### Boolean Helper
- `toggle()` - toggles from `false` to `true`

##### Array Mutation Helpers
- `push()`, `unshift()`, `splice()` - same as native but reactive
- `setIndex(index, value)` - Sets value at index
- `removeIndex(index)` - Remove index
- `setArrayProperty(indexOrProp, property, value)` - Set property at index or across all

##### Record Helpers (Array of Objects)
- `setProperty(id, property, value)` - set property on item matching id
- `replaceItem(item, id)` - replace item matching id
- `removeItem(id)` - Remove a specific item from array by id
- `getIndex(id)` - get index from id
- `getID(index)` - get id at an index
- `hasID(index)` - checks if index has an id

##### Date Helpers
- `now` - Set to current time


You can learn more about this in the documentation for [array helpers](#), [record helpers](), [date helpers](), and [boolean helpers]().
