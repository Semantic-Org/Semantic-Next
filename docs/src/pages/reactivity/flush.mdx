Reactivity changes do not happen immediately when values change but are "flushed" together with other changes. This is performed as a [`microtask` in the browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_DOM_API/Microtask_guide).

### Async Behavior

Flushes occur asynchronously when the microtask queue is processed. This means if multiple updates occur in sequence the reaction will only trigger once with the final value.

> Flushes are performed asynchronously to avoid performance issues when updating UI, ensuring that the UI only renders once with the final value of a reactive variable.

### Forcing Flush

You can trigger the queue to be immediately flushed to prevent this by using the `Reaction.flush()`.

This can make sure intermediate values trigger reactive updates.

### After Flush Callback

You can use `Reaction.afterFlush` to trigger a callback once after all reactions have been flushed.

This can be useful in cases where you want to query the DOM, trigger focus or other actions that should only occur after the UI has been updated.
