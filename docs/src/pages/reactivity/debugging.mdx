### Debugging

Reactivity can be complicated to debug as it requires an understanding of "what caused what" which is not as intuitive as simply seeing the callee of a function.

Semantic UI's reactivity implementation provides several different ways to handle debugging. For starters if you are adding your own custom breakpoints in code, `Reaction.current` will always reference the current Reaction being run (if any). You can check this to see what the source of a reaction is.

To make this even more simple `Reaction` exposes a special helpers `Reaction.getSource()` this will return a trace of the current context which causes a reaction specifically for debugging;

```javascript
// example output
Reaction triggered by:
    at Object.setActiveItem (https://dev.semantic-ui.com/src/components/InPageMenu/InPageMenu.js:126:23)
    at IntersectionObserver.onIntersection (https://dev.semantic-ui.com/src/components/InPageMenu/InPageMenu.js:244:13)
```

If you are trying to debug reactivity inside a template, you can add `{{debugReactivity}}`, this will trigger a breakpoint at this context in the template and call `Reaction.getSource()`.
