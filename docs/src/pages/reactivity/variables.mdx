### Setting Values

To create a reactive variable, you can use the `ReactiveVar` class from the `@semantic-ui/reactivity` package.

```javascript
import { ReactiveVar } from '@semantic-ui/reactivity';
const counter = new ReactiveVar(0);
```
### Accessing Values

To access the current value of a reactive variable, you can use `get()` or `value`

> To access a value without triggering reactivity you can use `peek`. See [controlling reactivity](/reactivity/controls).

```javascript
const counter = new ReactiveVar(0);
console.log(counter.get()); // Output: 0
console.log(counter.value); // Output: 0
```


### Updating Values

To update the value of a reactive variable, you can use the `set()` method, or any reactive helper function like `now`, `increment`

```javascript
counter.set(1);
console.log(counter.get()); // Output: 1
counter.increment();
console.log(counter.get()); // Output: 2
```

Alternatively, you can directly assign a new value to the `value` property:

```javascript
counter.value = 2;
console.log(counter.get()); // Output: 2
```

## Reactions

Reactive variables are typically used within a reactive context, this is a function that reruns when a reactive variable changes.

When a reactive variable is accessed within a reactive context, it establishes a dependency between the variable and the context. Whenever the value of the reactive variable changes, the reactive context is automatically re-run.

### Creating a Reaction

In this example we set up a reaction by calling `counter.get()` inside a `reaction`.

```javascript
import { ReactiveVar, Reaction } from '@semantic-ui/reactivity';

const counter = new ReactiveVar(0);

Reaction.create(() => {
  console.log('counter:', counter.get());
});

counter.set(1); // Output: counter: 1
counter.set(2); // Output: counter: 2
```

### Creating a Subscription

You can also use a `subscription` to call a specific callback everytime a value changes without creating a reactive context.

Unlike a `reaction` which tracks any reactive variable that is referenced and reruns when **any value is updated** a subscription will only rerun when a specified value is updated.

> Subscriptions are an alternative approach to reactivity which preventvalues in the callback from triggering reactivity.

```javascript
const subscription = counter.subscribe((newValue) => {
  console.log('counter changed:', newValue);
});

counter.set(3); // Output: counter changed: 3
```

Subscriptions return a reference to the current subscription. You can call `subscription.stop()` to stop the callback from occurring.

```javascript
subscription.stop();
```


## Reactive Conditions

### Equality Comparison

By default, reactive variables use a deep equality comparison to determine if the value has changed. This means that if you assign an object or array to a reactive variable, it will only trigger a reactive update if the contents of the object or array have changed.

```javascript
const person = new ReactiveVar({ name: 'John', age: 30 });

// No reactive update triggered
person.set({ name: 'John', age: 30 });

// Reactive update triggered
person.set({ name: 'Jane', age: 30 });
```

You can customize the equality comparison function by passing a custom function as the second argument to the `ReactiveVar` constructor:

```javascript
const customEquality = (a, b) => {
  // Custom equality comparison logic
  // Return true if a and b are considered equal
};

const customVar = new ReactiveVar(initialValue, customEquality);
```

## Reactivity Example

`ReactiveVar` are the only values that cause reactivity to occur in a reaction. When you create a `Reaction` it **will run immediately** then **re-run whenever a reactive value is updated**.
