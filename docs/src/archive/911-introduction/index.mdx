### Web Components Simplified
Semantic is a framework designed from the ground up to make it easier to author websites entirely using web standards.

### Key Features
* **Templating** - Reactive `AST` based html templates that render to the Shadow DOM using a highly performant `lit-html` renderer.
* **Reactive Data** - Modern reactive data bindings built with Signals.
* **Composable** - Components that render both to html tags or exported as partials with identical interfaces.
* **DOM Manipulation** - A modern, performant DOM querying library that can pierce the shadow DOM and uses a familiar chainable syntax.
* **Built for Browsers** - No compilation step, can run directly in your browser and imported using esmodules. Built in tools that make it easy to build for SSR.
* **And Much More** - Additional features like snippets, keybindings, component traversal, and shared state that make it possible to build entire websites using only web components.
