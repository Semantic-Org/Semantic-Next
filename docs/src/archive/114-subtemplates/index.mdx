### It's Time To Begin

The key to scaling design frameworks is consistent APIs. Web components allow you to encapsulate functionality into a custom element that can be used by front end developers in the same way they use other html tags when creating new pages.

```javascript
defineComponent({
  tagName: 'current-time',
});
```
```html
<current-time></current-time>
```

Components do not need to be assigned to tags, they can also be used in other components compositionally. This lets you build apps similar to how you might in a framework like React or Vue.

```javascript
const currentTime = defineComponent({ template, html, css });

defineComponent({
  tagName: 'greet-user',
  subTemplates: { currentTime }
});
```
```html
<greet-user></greet-user>
```
