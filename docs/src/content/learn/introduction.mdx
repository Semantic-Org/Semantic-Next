## About This Guide

Semantic is a **framework for building reusable/composable UI components using web components**. These components can be used directly in the browser, or inside a framework of your choosing that supports web components like `React`, `Vue` or `Svelte`.

### UI Framework
Semantic also includes a **first party UI framework** that provides themeable primitives like `button`, `menu`, `tab` that can be used directly anywhere you write html.

* **Component Framework** - A guide to building apps using semantic ui components.
