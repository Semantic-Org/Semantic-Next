### Developing in Practice

When coding a component it can be very helpful to see your styling, the structure of your component, and what it does side by side.

Semantic is designed around this harmonious separation between styling, structure and behavior.

### Separating Files

In browser or stateless environments you can load the contents of html and css from separate files using the included helper [`getText`](/api/utils/browser/#gettext). This will return the text value of an external file.

```javascript
const css = await getText('./component.css');
```

In compiled environments like ESbuild, Vite, or other build pipelines you can use

```javascript
import css from './component.css' assert { type: 'css' };
```
