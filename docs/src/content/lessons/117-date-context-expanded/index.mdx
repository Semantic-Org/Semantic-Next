### Data Context Expanded

Lets now look at how `dateSettings` retrieves the current timezone.

Your component's [data context](/components/rendering#data-context) can retrieve values from many different places in Semantic.

In this example you can see we are now adding a new value to our expression in `component.html`

```sui
{formatDate time 'h:mm:ss a' { timezone: timezone }}
```

Expressions can either be written using spaced arguments, as any valid javascript, or as a mixture of both.
```sui
{ formatDate(time, 'h:mm:ss a', { timezone: timezone}) }
```

Semantic components generally prefer spaced arguments for legibility, and to ensure template logic is defined outside of your template file.


> **Whats in a Context** - Your data context can pull values from many different places, internal state, external setting, properties or methods on your component, other components, or by passing in data directly through subtemplating.
