### A Real World Example
To help us learn about key features of Semantic we will be building a **filterable card layout**.

First we will build out a card, then add a card list and finally add filtering and searching.

## Separating Concerns

This example includes three files that define our card
* A javascript file `component.js` housing our card definition
* A css file `component.css` that is scoped to the component and uses some theme-aware variables like `angled-gradient` or `primary-text-color`
* A template file `component.html` which specifies the html from our card and uses expressions like `{name}` to output values
