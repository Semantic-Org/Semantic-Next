## Templates

A template defines how to construct the html for your component. It can include things like expressions, conditions, loops and more.

Templates and css can be imported in the browser using the `getText` helper to let you store them separately.

> With a compile step like esbuild or vite they can also be imported using esm string imports directly

For now lets just create some html to display a simple image.
