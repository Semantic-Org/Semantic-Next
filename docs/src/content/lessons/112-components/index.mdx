### Web Component Essentials

`defineComponent` will generate a custom html tag that you can use anywhere that you normally use html.

### Using Settings

You can use `settings` in a component to allow each component to be configured in a different way.

In `index.html` we include multiple instances of `<hello-world>` with different configurations.
