### What is Semantic

Semantic provides reactive templating, event management, and opinionated primitives for handling everything you need to ship UI that can be used and scaled by large teams with web standards like web components.

Components can be used directly in the browser without compilation as well as with existing frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte so that your UI can be portable between projects.


### It's Time To Begin

The key to scaling design frameworks is consistent APIs. Web components allow you to encapsulate functionality into a custom element that can be used by front end developers in the same way they use other html tags when creating new pages.

```javascript
defineComponent({
  tagName: 'current-time',
});
```
```html
<current-time></current-time>
```

Components do not need to be assigned to tags, they can also be used in other components compositionally. This lets you build apps similar to how you might in a framework like React or Vue.

```javascript
const currentTime = defineComponent({ template, html, css });

defineComponent({
  tagName: 'greet-user',
  subTemplates: { currentTime }
});
```
```html
<greet-user></greet-user>
```
