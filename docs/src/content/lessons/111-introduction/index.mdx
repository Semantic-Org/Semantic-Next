## Basics
Components in Semantic UI are created using `defineComponent`.

```javascript
import { defineComponent } from '@semantic-ui/component';

defineComponent({
  tagName: 'current-time',
  // ..rest
});
```

If a tag name is included it will also be defined as a web component that can be used in a page immediately.

```html
<current-time></current-time>
```
