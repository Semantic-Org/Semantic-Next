### What is Semantic

Semantic is a fully featured framework including everything you need to ship UI for large teams with web components.

* **Templating** - A reactive templating framework
* **Styling** - A css framework for building your components from useful defaults
* **Primitives** - A first party UI toolkit including primitives like button, menu and others.
* **Robustness** - Integrated systems for event management, key bindings and everything else to ship complex UI that can be used at scale by large steams
* **Portability** - Use web components directly in the browser or in React, Vue, Svelte, Angular or whatever comes next.

### How To Use This Guide

* **Resources** - Click the resources button to see a list of related resources to any particular lesson
* **Navigating** - Use next/previous below to navigate between lessons or <ui-icon menu></ui-icon> above to jump ahead.
* **Layout** - Click the layout button to swap between code panels and tabs (this may not be available on small screen sizes).

### Your First Component

The following example shows the minimal code required to generate a component.

Things to notice:
* The `defineComponent` function creates a new web component
* `tagName` determines your tag name `<hello-world></hello-world>`
* The component updates automatically when state changes
* Both template and styles are encapsulated inside the component
* Styles can use css tokens like `primary-text-color`
