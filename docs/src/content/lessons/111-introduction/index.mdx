### What is Semantic

Semantic is a fully featured framework including everything you need to ship UI for large teams with web components.

* **Templating** - A reactive templating framework
* **Styling** - A css framework for building your components from useful defaults
* **Primitives** - A first party UI toolkit including primitives like button, menu and others.
* **Robustness** - Integrated systems for event management, key bindings and everything else to ship complex UI that can be used at scale by large steams
* **Portability** - Use web components directly in the browser or in React, Vue, Svelte, Angular or whatever comes next.
