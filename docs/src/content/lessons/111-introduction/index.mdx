Semantic is a lightweight framework providing **templating**, **reactivity**, **event management** and more so you can build your next project entirely with web standards like web components.

Semantic components can be used **directly in the browser without a compile step** or with frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte making your UI portable between projects.

### Hello World Time
This lesson includes a simple web component to output the current time.

We'll dive into how this works in a bit, but perhaps this can help you get oriented to the feel of the API.

```javascript
defineComponent({
  tagName: 'current-time',
});
```
```html
<current-time></current-time>
```
