Semantic makes it easy to create apps using web standards, by packaging **templating, reactivity, event management, and more** into an integrated framework that render as web components that **can be used directly in the browser without compilation**.

### Hello World Time
Here's a simple web component to output the current time. We'll dive into how this works in a bit, but perhaps this can help you get oriented to the feel of the API.

```javascript
defineComponent({
  tagName: 'current-time',
});
```
```html
<current-time></current-time>
```
