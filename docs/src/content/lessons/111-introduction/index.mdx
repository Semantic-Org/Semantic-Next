### What is Semantic

Semantic provides reactive templating, event management, and opinionated primitives for handling everything you need to ship UI to scale codebases for growing teams with web standards like web components.

### Framework Agnostic

Components can be used directly in the browser without compilation as well as with existing frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte so that your UI can be portable between projects.


### Building Apps with Web Components

Components can be assigned a `tagName` to make it easy to build new pages or layouts with them. You can use this to build a design framework for your team.

```javascript
defineComponent({
  tagName: 'greet-user',
});
```

```html
<greet-user name="jack"></greet-user>
```

You can also use components without assigning them to tag names. These components can be used inside other components to build entire apps just like you would with other front end frameworks.

```javascript
export const topbar = defineComponent({ template, css, createComponent });
export const sidebar = defineComponent({ template, css, createComponent });
export const content = defineComponent({ template, css, createComponent });

defineComponent({
  tagName: 'my-app',
  template: `
    {>topbar}
    {>sidebar}
    {>content}
  `
  subTemplates: { topbar, sidebar, content }
});
```

It's up to you to decide which components are exposed with public interfaces and which are not.
