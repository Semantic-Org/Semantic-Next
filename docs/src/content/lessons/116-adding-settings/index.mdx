### Exposing Settings

Your components are not just limited to internal `state`. You can use `settings` to let each instance have its own configuration.

Since we are using `tagName` our components `settings` can be configured by adjusting the html attributes or properties on the DOM element associated with the component.

### Explaining the Example

We are adding `city` and `timezone` which can now be used to modify the time display.

You can see in [`index.html`](/#index.html)
```html
<current-time city="Norfolk" timezone="EST"></current-time>
<current-time city="Los Angeles" timezone="PST"></current-time>
```

This adjusts the `settings` in `createComponent` to be a different `setting.city` and `setting.timezone` for each instance.
