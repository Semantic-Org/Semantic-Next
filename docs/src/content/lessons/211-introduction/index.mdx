## Beginning Your Journey

Semantic is a framework that makes it **easy to build websites using only web components**.

Web components can be used directly in the browser with vanilla `html`, or inside a framework of your choosing that supports web components like `React`, `Vue` or `Svelte`.

### What's Covered

The component guide will take you through:
* **Templating** - Write reactive html templates that render to web components.
* **Reactive Data** - Update your components when data changes.
* **Define Components** - Specify behaviors and invoke them externally.
* **Events** - Dispatch and listen to events from components.
* **Advanced Usage** - Additional features like subtemplates, snippets, keybindings, component traversal, shared state that make it possible to build entire websites using only web components.

### UI Framework
Semantic also includes a **first party UI framework** that provides themeable primitives like `button`, `menu`, `tab` that can be used directly anywhere you write html. You can use the UI without the framework, and the framework without the UI-- its up to you!
