A template defines how to construct your component's DOM from available data.

Expressions are wrapped in either `{ }` or `{{ }}` and can be used to access your data context.

```sui
The caption is {caption}
```

Methods can also be accessed with parameters passed to the right
```sui
The caption is {{getCaption 'short'}}
```
```javascript
getCaption('short');
```

### Data Context

The simplest form of data store is `state` which is a reactive data store for internal state.


In this example we are using `state` to store details that we might want to update for an image like `caption` and `src`.


```javascript
defineComponent({
  state: {
    currentImage: '/images/avatar/jenny.jpg',
    caption: 'First Image'
  },
  // other config
});
```
