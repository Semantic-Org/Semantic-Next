A template defines how to construct your component's DOM from available data, it combines to an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) which is used to create your component.

> You can view the AST using the menu to the right next to 'preview'

### Syntax
Expressions can be used to access your data context and are either be wrapped in `{ }` or `{{ }}`, it doesn't matter as long as its consistent across the file.
```sui
<img src={src}>
```
```sui
<img src={{src}}>
```

### Functions

Your data context can also include functions and nested expressions with parenthesis.

```sui
<img src={getProfileImage (getUser userID) 'large'}>
```

```javascript
getProfileImage(getUser(userID), 'large');
```


### Data Context

Your data context includes a variety of sources that we'll cover in upcoming lessons, but for now lets talk about `state` which is an internal reactive data store.

```javascript
defineComponent({
  state: {
    currentImage: '/images/avatar/jenny.jpg',
    caption: 'First Image'
  },
  // other config
});
```
