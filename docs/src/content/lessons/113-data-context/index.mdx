A template defines how to construct your component's DOM from available data.

Template strings are compiled to an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) which provides instructions on how to recreate your component.

### Syntax

Templates **use your components data context to produce the html for your component**. Reactive data sources surgically update only the parts of the DOM that need  to rerender when your data changes.

Expressions can be used to access your data context and are either be wrapped in `{ }` or `{{ }}`, it doesn't matter as long as its consistent across the file.
```sui
<img src={src}>
```
```sui
<img src={{src}}>
```

### Data

A components data context is a combination of internal `state`, `settings` (user settable state), and methods and properties on your component instance.

```javascript
data = {
  ...state,
  ...settings,
  ...component
};
```

### Complex Data

Expressions can also access functions and supports nested expressions with `()`.

Arguments are parsed right to left.

```sui
<img src={getProfileImage (getUser userID) 'large'}>
```

```javascript
getProfileImage(getUser(userID), 'large');
```
