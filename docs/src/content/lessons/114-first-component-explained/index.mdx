### Understanding the Example

Lets delve into what exactly is happening in this example.

* `date` is defined in [`state`](/components/rendering#state) and set to a default value of `new Date()`.

* The [`onCreated` callback](/components/lifecycle#oncreated) creates an interval that updates the value of `state.date` every second using  [`now()`](/api/reactivity/date-helpers#now).

* The date is output using the expression `formatDate time "h:mm:ss a"`

* Time is retrieved from the template's [data context](components/rendering#data-context).

* [`formatDate`](/api/helpers/dates#formatdate) is an included [ helper](/templates/helpers) this is called with the results of the other expressions evaluated right to left. `formatDate(time, 'h:mm ss a')`.

* The css includes a CSS token `primary-text-color` which is defined in the CSS framework. Variables can be used in your components to reference global styling like, font, size, padding and more.
