### Your First Component

`defineComponent` is used to define any UI you would like to reuse for your application.

In this example we use some of the most common features of a component:

* **Tag Name** - A custom element to assign your component to.
* **Template** - A template that specifies the html rendered by your component.
* **CSS** - CSS scoped to your component.
* **State** - A signals based reactivity store for your component.
* **Lifecycle callbacks** - Callbacks that let you when a component is created, rendered or destroyed.

> **Rendering** - You do not need to specify a render function. Components will automatically rerender based on your data and template.
