## Create Component

`createComponent` is used to return the component instance. This is why createComponent is a function that returns an object.

We have now added a new method on our component `dateSettings`, this is invoked directly from our template to return the settings object for the date.

## Everything Destructured

The primary way callbacks interface with data in a component is through destructuring [lifecycle callback arguments](/components/lifecycle#callback-arguments). There are many things you can access from callbacks, special flags like `isServer`, `isDarkMode`, the rendering `el`, the `state`, or `settings`, or much more.

In our example we are now accessing `settings` to pull the **run-time settings for this instance of the component**.

Underneath the hood `settings`  uses a [`ProxyObject`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy), so the value is always up to date without a `get()` or `value` accessor.
