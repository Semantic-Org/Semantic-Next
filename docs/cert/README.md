# Self Signed Certs

These are self signed certs created with [`mkcert`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) and used to serve the documentation to `https://dev.semantic-ui.com` in the browser.

You will need to install these certs locally for Chrome to show the SSL certs as trusted, and for the 'playground' section to work.
